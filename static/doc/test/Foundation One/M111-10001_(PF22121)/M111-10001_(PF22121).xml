              <Interpretation>KIT (also called c-KIT) encodes a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon ligand binding and dimerization, activates the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways (Linnekin, 1999; 10582339). KIT aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies, and KIT is considered an oncoprotein (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). KIT has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In the TCGA datasets, KIT amplification has been reported in 2.5% of lower grade gliomas (grades 2 and 3)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751) and 9.2% of glioblastomas (Grade 4 astrocytoma)(cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). KIT amplification has been variously reported in 4-47% of glioblastomas in the scientific literature (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Burford et al., 2013; 23990986). Amplification of KIT has been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or PDGFRA amplification in glioblastoma (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383). One study found no correlation between KIT amplification and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma, while a separate study reported that overexpression of KIT was associated with tumor grade and shorter survival in patients with malignant glioma (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Skardelly et al., 2009; 19701495). On the basis of clinical evidence, primarily in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), melanoma, AML, and systemic mastocytosis, KIT activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to TKIs including imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, ponatinib, midostaurin, apatinib, avapritinib, and ripretinib (Heinrich et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10506, Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, DeAngelo et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 2, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Abbaspour Babaei et al., 2016; 27536065, Ramaswamy et al., 2016; 27563456, Demetri et al., 2013; 23177515, Gotlib et al., 2016; 27355533, Jawhar et al., 2017; 28424161, Xu et al., 2014; 25031773, Gotlib et al., 2005; 15972446, George et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11511, Luo et al., 2017; 29066909). The use of mTOR inhibitors as an alternative therapeutic strategy has demonstrated limited success in KIT-mutated, imatinib-resistant melanoma, with 1 PR and 3 SD observed for 4 patients treated with everolimus (Si et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 8562, Si et al., 2012; 22162580). However, no responses were observed for 10 patients with mastocytosis following everolimus monotherapy, with 8/10 patients harboring the KIT D816V mutation (Parikh et al., 2010; 20038218). The role of KIT amplification as a biomarker for response to mTOR inhibitors has not been investigated (PubMed, Mar 2022). Clinical benefit has been observed for patients with KIT amplified or overexpressing tumors following treatment with imatinib (Wei et al., 2019; 30075827, Hodi et al., 2013; 23775962, Carvajal et al., 2011; 21642685, Guo et al., 2011; 21690468, Debiec-Rychter et al., 2005; 15685537, DeMatteo et al., 2009; 19303137, Faivre et al., 2005; 16135502, Hotte et al., 2005; 15659505, Alcedo et al., 2004; 15350030, Brandwein et al., 2011; 21403650, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263), nilotinib (Lee et al., 2015; 26424760), sorafenib (Llovet et al., 2012; 22374331, Zhang et al., 2013; 23058498, Seino et al., 2014; 25450081, Li et al., 2009; 18846437), and sunitinib (Minor et al., 2012; 22261812, Mahipal et al., 2012; 23114504), suggesting that KIT amplification may be sensitive to these inhibitors. However, evidence demonstrating clinical benefit for regorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib, or ponatinib in the context of KIT amplified or overexpressing tumors is limited.</Interpretation>
              <Include>true</Include>
              <ClinicalTrialNote>KIT amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Also, because KIT activation leads to activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, PI3K and mTOR pathway inhibitors may be relevant in a tumor with KIT activation.</ClinicalTrialNote>

                  <Rationale>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approved Indications:&lt;/b&gt; Sorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that targets the RAF kinases, KIT, FLT3, RET, VEGFRs, and PDGFRs. It is FDA approved for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, advanced renal cell carcinoma, and recurrent or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Please see the drug label for full prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gene Association:&lt;/b&gt; On the basis of clinical and preclinical data in KIT-mutated (Quintás-Cardama et al., 2008; 18936790, Bisagni et al., 2009; 19461405, Handolias et al., 2010; 20372153, Disel et al., 2011; 20970876, Park et al., 2012; 22270258, Catania et al., 2014; 24855380, Guo et al., 2007; 17699867, Hu et al., 2008; 18483300) or KIT-expressing tumors (Llovet et al., 2012; 22374331, Zhang et al., 2013; 23058498, Seino et al., 2014; 25450081, Li et al., 2009; 18846437), KIT activating alterations may predict sensitivity to sorafenib. On the basis of clinical responses in patients with GIST, PDGFRA activating mutations may predict sensitivity to sorafenib (Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P)(Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; Phase 2 studies of sorafenib plus temozolomide report limited activity in patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Zustovich et al., 2013; 23898124; Reardon et al., 2011; 20443129). A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib in patients with glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6 month progression-free survival (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651). A Phase 2 trial of sorafenib and erlotinib in glioblastoma also did not meet its primary endpoint, and erlotinib clearance was increased by the addition of sorafenib (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). In a Phase 1 trial in patients with high-grade glioma, the combination of sorafenib with radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) resulted in increased toxicity and did not result in significant improvement in clinical efficacy compared with RT and TMZ alone (Hottinger et al., 2014; 24786603). In a clinical study of sorafenib in pediatric patients with low-grade astrocytoma, one patient achieved a partial response (PR), one had stable disease (SD), and 9 patients had progressive disease; this study was terminated early due to unexpectedly high disease progression rates (Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

                  <Rationale>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approved Indications:&lt;/b&gt; Nilotinib targets tyrosine kinases such as ABL (including BCR-ABL), PDGFRs, KIT, CSF1R, DDR1, and DDR2. It is FDA approved to treat newly diagnosed pediatric or adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, adults with Ph+ CML in chronic or accelerated phase with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib, and pediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase with resistance or intolerance to prior tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy. Please see the drug label for full prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gene Association:&lt;/b&gt; On the basis of clinical and preclinical data in KIT-mutated (Lee et al., 2015; 26424760, Carvajal et al., 2015; 25695690, Hochhaus et al., 2015; 26002753, Blay et al., 2015; 25882987, Kaijimoto et al., 2015; 26722383), KIT-amplified (Lee et al., 2015; 26424760), or KIT-expressing tumors (Sako et al., 2014; 25221952), KIT activating alterations may confer sensitivity to nilotinib. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical data on the efficacy of nilotinib for the treatment of CNS tumors are limited (PubMed, Jul 2022). Nilotinib has been primarily investigated as a therapeutic option for the treatment of CML or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). In the context of CML, a Phase 3 clinical trial of Ph+ patients treated with imatinib or nilotinib (300 mg or 400 mg) reported progression-free survival (PFS) rates of 93% and 97-98% and overall survival (OS) rates of 93% and 94-97%, respectively, at 4 years (Hughes et al., 2014; 24335106). For imatinib-resistant Japanese patients with CML, a Phase 2 trial reported a 47.8% major medical response rate to treatment with nilotinib at 12 months (Takahashi et al., 2014; 24650752). A Phase 3 clinical trial of single-agent nilotinib in 240 patients with advanced GIST who failed prior treatment with imatinib or sunitinib reported no significant difference in progression-free survival between nilotinib and the best supportive care, but did report increased overall survival for nilotinib-treated patients (Reichardt et al., 2012; 22357255). A Phase 2 trial has shown that nilotinib was well tolerated and suggested it may be particularly useful for treating patients with GIST harboring mutations in KIT exon 17 (Cauchi et al., 2012; 22119758). Preclinical, cell-based assays have reported efficacy for nilotinib alone and in combination with additional therapies in the context of leiomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma (Villar et al., 2012; 22662203). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

                  <Rationale>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approved Indications:&lt;/b&gt; Imatinib targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein, PDGFR, and KIT. It is FDA approved for the treatment of KIT-positive gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative syndrome (MDS/MPS), aggressive systemic mastocytosis without a D816V KIT mutation, hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Please see the drug label for full prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gene Association:&lt;/b&gt; On the basis of strong clinical evidence, PDGFRA activating mutations (Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666), fusions (Baccarani et al., 2007; 17666373, Curtis et al., 2007; 17555450, Griffin et al., 2003; 12808148, Helbig et al., 2009; 19120352, Klion et al., 2004; 14504092, Qu et al., 2016; 27120808, Metzgeroth et al., 2007; 17377585, Metzgeroth et al., 2008; 18950453, Ogbogu et al., 2009; 19910029, Sugimoto et al., 2015; 26319757), and expression (Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816) may predict sensitivity to imatinib. On the basis of clinical and preclinical data in KIT-mutated (Carvajal et al., 2011; 21642685, Debiec-Rychter et al., 2006; 16624552, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Hodi et al., 2013; 23775962), KIT-amplified (Wei et al., 2019; 30075827, Guo et al., 2011; 21690468, Hodi et al., 2013; 23775962, Carvajal et al., 2011; 21642685), or KIT-expressing tumors (DeMatteo et al., 2009; 19303137, Faivre et al., 2005; 16135502, Alcedo et al., 2004; 15350030, Brandwein et al., 2011; 21403650, Hotte et al., 2005; 15659505, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263, Kamenz et al., 2006; 16570351, Wang et al., 2005; 15650049), KIT activating alterations may confer sensitivity to imatinib. PDGFRA amplification may predict sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib; a patient with Merkel cell carcinoma expressing PDGFRA achieved a complete response to imatinib (Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; In a clinical study where patients with recurrent glioblastoma were given imatinib, 2/24 patients achieved a PR, 10 patients reported SD, and median OS and PFS was observed to be 6.2 and 3 months, respectively (Hassler et al., 2014; 25674429). However, other Phase 2 clinical trials of imatinib have reported no anti-tumor activity, with a study of 231 patients with glioblastoma reporting a radiographic response rate of only 3.4% (Razis et al., 2009; 19789313, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263). In another Phase 2 study, imatinib plus hydroxyurea was shown to be well tolerated among patients with recurrent/progressive low-grade glioma, but had negligible antitumor activity (Reardon et al., 2012; 22371319). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

A Phase 2 trial that examined sunitinib treatment followed by radiation therapy in patients with glioblastoma reported a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.7 weeks, and a median overall survival (OS) of 12.8 weeks; 83.3% (10/12) of patients experienced neurological deterioration prior to radiation therapy (Balaña et al., 2014; 24424564). Another Phase 2 study that examined daily sunitinib treatment in patients with glioblastoma reported no objective response in any of the 40 patients, with a median PFS of 2.2 months and a median OS of 9.2 months; five patients in the study had stable disease for more than six months (Hutterer et al., 2014; 24311637). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

              <Interpretation>MDM4 acts as a negative regulator of p53, but a fraction of MDM4 localized to the mitochondria acts in concert with p53 to promote apoptosis (Mancini et al., 2009; 19521340). MDM4 has been reported to be amplified in cancer and therapies targeting MDM4 or MDM2 have been shown to increase levels of the tumor suppressor p53 in cancer cells (Wade et al., 2013; 23303139, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Danovi et al., 2004; 15199139, Beging et al., 2014; 24739573). In the TCGA dataset, amplification of MDM4 was observed in 8.5% of glioblastoma cases (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). MDM4 amplification or amplification of the 1q32.1 chromosomal locus, which encompasses MDM4 and PIK3C2B, has been frequently reported, particularly in Grade 3 and 4 astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cases; one study reported MDM4 amplification in 27% (23/86) of astrocytoma samples (Arjona et al., 2005; 16319692, Schiffman et al., 2010; 20068183, Nobusawa et al., 2010; 20406234, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Jin et al., 2010; 20472715, Riemenschneider et al., 1999; 10626796). A study also reported MDM4 amplification in 4% (4/106) of GBMs and in 4% (1/27) of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas; MDM4 amplification was not detected in any of the 56 low-grade (Grade 1 or 2) gliomas investigated (Riemenschneider et al., 1999; 10626796). The association of MDM4 amplification with tumor grade in astrocytomas is unclear (Arjona et al., 2005; 16319692, Schiffman et al., 2010; 20068183). Small molecules targeting MDM4 or the MDM2-MDM4 complex, such as idasanutlin, have reported clinical benefit for patients with polycythemia vera (Mascarenhas et al., 2022; 34933330, Mascarenhas et al., 2019; 31167802) and AML (Reis et al 2016; 26869629) and have shown anti-tumor activity in preclinical assays (Chen et al., 2019; 30536898). Additional nutlins have been in preclinical and clinical development (Vaseva et al., 2011; 21562588, Wang and Yan, 2011; 21750655, Wang et al., 2011; 21075910, Reed et al., 2010; 20080970, Smalley et al., 2007; 17210701, Vogel et al., 2012; 23035244, Mandke et al., 2012; 22870278) and have been shown to be effective against cancer cells in the presence of a wildtype p53 allele (Hirose et al., 2014; 25621298, Chang et al., 2013; 23946421, Bernal et al., 2010; 21075307, Wade et al., 2013; 23303139). Additional therapeutic mechanisms that target MDM4 are also in preclinical development (Vogel et al., 2012; 23035244, Mandke et al., 2012; 22870278).</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>PDGFRA encodes platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-alpha), a tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon binding of cognate ligands (PDGFA or PDGFB), activates several signaling pathways, including PI3K and MAPK (Andrae et al., 2008; 18483217). PDGFR aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and/or overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). Amplification of PDGFRA, frequently occurring with amplification of the genes KDR and KIT, has been associated with increased PDGFRA expression (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Flavahan et al., 2016; 26700815, Roszik et al., 2016; 26787600, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251) and poor prognosis (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Koschmann et al., 2016; 27582545, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Puget et al., 2012; 22389665) in some subtypes of glioma. The PDGFRA rearrangement in this tumor results in deletion of exons 8-9. The PDGFRA exon 8-9 deletion mutant was demonstrated to be active in the absence of ligand and has been characterized as transforming (Clarke et al., 2003; 12569364, Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717). This mutant was sensitive to imatinib and the kinase inhibitor vatalanib (Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717). Although alterations such as E229K and R841K seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. PDGFRA amplification has been suggested to be more common in higher grade astrocytomas than in lower grade astrocytomas; studies have reported PDGFRA amplification in 16.3% (27/166) of Grade 2 astrocytomas and in 23.6% (91/386) of Grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas analyzed (Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Motomura et al., 2013; 23242283). PDGFRA amplification has been reported in 5.2-33% of glioblastoma cases (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200). PDGFRA mutation has been identified in 5.6% of Grade 3 and 5.4% of Grade 4 astrocytomas, 2.4% of Grade 3 oligodendrogliomas, and 12% (3/25) of gliosarcomas analyzed in COSMIC (Feb 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). PDGFRA mutations have been reported in 0-5% of lower grade glioma and glioblastoma samples (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, cBio-Hoadley et al., 2018; 29625048, cBio-Ellrott et al., 2018; 29596782, cBio-Taylor et al., 2018; 29622463, cBio-Gao et al., 2018; 29617662, cBio-Liu et al., 2018; 29625055, cBio-Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018; 29625050), Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio-Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio-Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509, cBio-Jones et al., 2013; 23817572). A retrospective analysis of TCGA glioma samples reported elevated expression of ERBB3 correlated with PDGFRA expression and co-expression of these genes was an indicator of poor prognosis in a GBM patient cohort (Song et al., 2018; 29888103). Amplification of PDGFRA has been associated with tumor grade and poor progression-free and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma (Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). In addition, PDGFRA amplification has been reported to occur in conjunction with IDH1 mutation in glioblastoma, and both alterations in the same tumor have been associated with poor patient prognosis (Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). Amplification of PDGFRA has also been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or KIT amplification in glioblastomas, as well as with EGFR amplification (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383, Szerlip et al., 2012; 22323597). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence in solid tumors and hematologic cancers, PDGFRA activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to imatinib (Arefi et al., 2012; 22806436, Baccarani et al., 2007; 17666373, Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Chalmers et al., 2015; 25658984, Cools et al., 2003; 12660384, Curtis et al., 2007; 17555450, Debiec-Rychter et al., 2016; 15010069, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Florian et al., 2006; 16406018, Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816, Griffin et al., 2003; 12808148, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Helbig et al., 2009; 19120352, Helbig et al., 2014; 24009127, Hus et al., 2011; 21093052, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Intermesoli et al., 2009; 19735261, Jain et al., 2009; 19013640, Jovanovic et al., 2007; 17299092, Kang et al., 2012; 22150077, Klion et al., 2004; 14504092, Kobayashi et al., 2009; 19192229, Kocáková et al., 2014; 24635438, Metzgeroth et al., 2008; 18950453, Murayama et al., 2012; 22645636, Ogbogu et al., 2009; 19910029, Ohnishi et al., 2006; 16856885, Pardanani et al., 2003; 12842979, Pardanani et al., 2004; 15284118, Qu et al., 2016; 27120808, Score et al., 2006; 16498388, Shah et al., 2011; 24669761, Sugimoto et al., 2015; 26319757, Volz et al., 2011; 20609486, von Bubnoff et al., 2005; 15618966, Walz et al., 2006; 16845659, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666). Sorafenib has shown clinical and preclinical activity against the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) and mutations associated with clinical resistance to imatinib and sunitinib in both CEL and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)(Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P, Al-Riyami et al., 2013; 23157309, Lierman et al., 2006; 16645167, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337, Metzgeroth et al., 2012; 21818111, Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526, Von Bubnoff et al., 2011; 20972453). Complete responses to nilotinib have been reported in patients with CEL or hypereosinophilic syndrome with FIP1L1-PDGFRA or activating mutations (Hochhaus et al., 2013; 24057647, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Tabouret et al., 2011; 20832858); preclinical evidence has reported efficacy of nilotinib in the context of PDGFRA mutations associated with GIST (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Weisberg et al., 2006; 17087936). Patients with GIST harboring PDGFRA activating mutations have been reported to derive clinical benefit from treatment with sunitinib (Heinrich et al., 2006; ASCO Abstract 9502, Brohl et al., 2015; 26396737) or regorafenib (Grellety et al., 2015; 28031906, Kollar et al., 2014; 25905001). Preclinical studies have reported sensitivity of activating PDGFRA mutations and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion to dasatinib (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337). PDGFRA D842 mutations were reported to be sensitive to avapritinib in clinical (Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) and preclinical (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) studies of GIST, and demonstrated sensitivity to ripretinib for 1 patient (Jaku et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2515).</Interpretation>

On the basis of clinical responses in patients with GIST, PDGFRA activating mutations may predict sensitivity to sorafenib (Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P)(Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; Phase 2 studies of sorafenib plus temozolomide report limited activity in patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Zustovich et al., 2013; 23898124; Reardon et al., 2011; 20443129). A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib in patients with glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6 month progression-free survival (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651). A Phase 2 trial of sorafenib and erlotinib in glioblastoma also did not meet its primary endpoint, and erlotinib clearance was increased by the addition of sorafenib (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). In a Phase 1 trial in patients with high-grade glioma, the combination of sorafenib with radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) resulted in increased toxicity and did not result in significant improvement in clinical efficacy compared with RT and TMZ alone (Hottinger et al., 2014; 24786603). In a clinical study of sorafenib in pediatric patients with low-grade astrocytoma, one patient achieved a partial response (PR), one had stable disease (SD), and 9 patients had progressive disease; this study was terminated early due to unexpectedly high disease progression rates (Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

However, other Phase 2 clinical trials of imatinib have reported no anti-tumor activity, with a study of 231 patients with glioblastoma reporting a radiographic response rate of only 3.4% (Razis et al., 2009; 19789313, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263). In another Phase 2 study, imatinib plus hydroxyurea was shown to be well tolerated among patients with recurrent/progressive low-grade glioma, but had negligible antitumor activity (Reardon et al., 2012; 22371319). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

              <Interpretation>PDGFRA encodes platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-alpha), a tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon binding of cognate ligands (PDGFA or PDGFB), activates several signaling pathways, including PI3K and MAPK (Andrae et al., 2008; 18483217). PDGFR aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and/or overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). Amplification of PDGFRA, frequently occurring with amplification of the genes KDR and KIT, has been associated with increased PDGFRA expression (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Flavahan et al., 2016; 26700815, Roszik et al., 2016; 26787600, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251) and poor prognosis (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Koschmann et al., 2016; 27582545, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Puget et al., 2012; 22389665) in some subtypes of glioma. The PDGFRA rearrangement in this tumor results in deletion of exons 8-9. The PDGFRA exon 8-9 deletion mutant was demonstrated to be active in the absence of ligand and has been characterized as transforming (Clarke et al., 2003; 12569364, Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717). This mutant was sensitive to imatinib and the kinase inhibitor vatalanib (Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717). Although alterations such as E229K and R841K seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. PDGFRA amplification has been suggested to be more common in higher grade astrocytomas than in lower grade astrocytomas; studies have reported PDGFRA amplification in 16.3% (27/166) of Grade 2 astrocytomas and in 23.6% (91/386) of Grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas analyzed (Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Motomura et al., 2013; 23242283). PDGFRA amplification has been reported in 5.2-33% of glioblastoma cases (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200). PDGFRA mutation has been identified in 5.6% of Grade 3 and 5.4% of Grade 4 astrocytomas, 2.4% of Grade 3 oligodendrogliomas, and 12% (3/25) of gliosarcomas analyzed in COSMIC (Feb 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). PDGFRA mutations have been reported in 0-5% of lower grade glioma and glioblastoma samples (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, cBio-Hoadley et al., 2018; 29625048, cBio-Ellrott et al., 2018; 29596782, cBio-Taylor et al., 2018; 29622463, cBio-Gao et al., 2018; 29617662, cBio-Liu et al., 2018; 29625055, cBio-Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018; 29625050), Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio-Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio-Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509, cBio-Jones et al., 2013; 23817572). A retrospective analysis of TCGA glioma samples reported elevated expression of ERBB3 correlated with PDGFRA expression and co-expression of these genes was an indicator of poor prognosis in a GBM patient cohort (Song et al., 2018; 29888103). Amplification of PDGFRA has been associated with tumor grade and poor progression-free and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma (Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). In addition, PDGFRA amplification has been reported to occur in conjunction with IDH1 mutation in glioblastoma, and both alterations in the same tumor have been associated with poor patient prognosis (Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). Amplification of PDGFRA has also been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or KIT amplification in glioblastomas, as well as with EGFR amplification (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383, Szerlip et al., 2012; 22323597). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence in solid tumors and hematologic cancers, PDGFRA activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to imatinib (Arefi et al., 2012; 22806436, Baccarani et al., 2007; 17666373, Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Chalmers et al., 2015; 25658984, Cools et al., 2003; 12660384, Curtis et al., 2007; 17555450, Debiec-Rychter et al., 2016; 15010069, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Florian et al., 2006; 16406018, Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816, Griffin et al., 2003; 12808148, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Helbig et al., 2009; 19120352, Helbig et al., 2014; 24009127, Hus et al., 2011; 21093052, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Intermesoli et al., 2009; 19735261, Jain et al., 2009; 19013640, Jovanovic et al., 2007; 17299092, Kang et al., 2012; 22150077, Klion et al., 2004; 14504092, Kobayashi et al., 2009; 19192229, Kocáková et al., 2014; 24635438, Metzgeroth et al., 2008; 18950453, Murayama et al., 2012; 22645636, Ogbogu et al., 2009; 19910029, Ohnishi et al., 2006; 16856885, Pardanani et al., 2003; 12842979, Pardanani et al., 2004; 15284118, Qu et al., 2016; 27120808, Score et al., 2006; 16498388, Shah et al., 2011; 24669761, Sugimoto et al., 2015; 26319757, Volz et al., 2011; 20609486, von Bubnoff et al., 2005; 15618966, Walz et al., 2006; 16845659, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666). Sorafenib has shown clinical and preclinical activity against the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) and mutations associated with clinical resistance to imatinib and sunitinib in both CEL and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)(Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P, Al-Riyami et al., 2013; 23157309, Lierman et al., 2006; 16645167, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337, Metzgeroth et al., 2012; 21818111, Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526, Von Bubnoff et al., 2011; 20972453). Complete responses to nilotinib have been reported in patients with CEL or hypereosinophilic syndrome with FIP1L1-PDGFRA or activating mutations (Hochhaus et al., 2013; 24057647, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Tabouret et al., 2011; 20832858); preclinical evidence has reported efficacy of nilotinib in the context of PDGFRA mutations associated with GIST (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Weisberg et al., 2006; 17087936). Patients with GIST harboring PDGFRA activating mutations have been reported to derive clinical benefit from treatment with sunitinib (Heinrich et al., 2006; ASCO Abstract 9502, Brohl et al., 2015; 26396737) or regorafenib (Grellety et al., 2015; 28031906, Kollar et al., 2014; 25905001). Preclinical studies have reported sensitivity of activating PDGFRA mutations and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion to dasatinib (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337). PDGFRA D842 mutations were reported to be sensitive to avapritinib in clinical (Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) and preclinical (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) studies of GIST, and demonstrated sensitivity to ripretinib for 1 patient (Jaku et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2515).</Interpretation>

On the basis of clinical responses in patients with GIST, PDGFRA activating mutations may predict sensitivity to sorafenib (Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P)(Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; Phase 2 studies of sorafenib plus temozolomide report limited activity in patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Zustovich et al., 2013; 23898124; Reardon et al., 2011; 20443129). A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib in patients with glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6 month progression-free survival (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651). A Phase 2 trial of sorafenib and erlotinib in glioblastoma also did not meet its primary endpoint, and erlotinib clearance was increased by the addition of sorafenib (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). In a Phase 1 trial in patients with high-grade glioma, the combination of sorafenib with radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) resulted in increased toxicity and did not result in significant improvement in clinical efficacy compared with RT and TMZ alone (Hottinger et al., 2014; 24786603). In a clinical study of sorafenib in pediatric patients with low-grade astrocytoma, one patient achieved a partial response (PR), one had stable disease (SD), and 9 patients had progressive disease; this study was terminated early due to unexpectedly high disease progression rates (Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

              <Interpretation>PDGFRA encodes platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-alpha), a tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon binding of cognate ligands (PDGFA or PDGFB), activates several signaling pathways, including PI3K and MAPK (Andrae et al., 2008; 18483217). PDGFR aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and/or overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). Amplification of PDGFRA, frequently occurring with amplification of the genes KDR and KIT, has been associated with increased PDGFRA expression (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Flavahan et al., 2016; 26700815, Roszik et al., 2016; 26787600, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251) and poor prognosis (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Koschmann et al., 2016; 27582545, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Puget et al., 2012; 22389665) in some subtypes of glioma. The PDGFRA rearrangement in this tumor results in deletion of exons 8-9. The PDGFRA exon 8-9 deletion mutant was demonstrated to be active in the absence of ligand and has been characterized as transforming (Clarke et al., 2003; 12569364, Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717). This mutant was sensitive to imatinib and the kinase inhibitor vatalanib (Ozawa et al., 2010; 20889717). Although alterations such as E229K and R841K seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. PDGFRA amplification has been suggested to be more common in higher grade astrocytomas than in lower grade astrocytomas; studies have reported PDGFRA amplification in 16.3% (27/166) of Grade 2 astrocytomas and in 23.6% (91/386) of Grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas analyzed (Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Motomura et al., 2013; 23242283). PDGFRA amplification has been reported in 5.2-33% of glioblastoma cases (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200). PDGFRA mutation has been identified in 5.6% of Grade 3 and 5.4% of Grade 4 astrocytomas, 2.4% of Grade 3 oligodendrogliomas, and 12% (3/25) of gliosarcomas analyzed in COSMIC (Feb 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). PDGFRA mutations have been reported in 0-5% of lower grade glioma and glioblastoma samples (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, cBio-Hoadley et al., 2018; 29625048, cBio-Ellrott et al., 2018; 29596782, cBio-Taylor et al., 2018; 29622463, cBio-Gao et al., 2018; 29617662, cBio-Liu et al., 2018; 29625055, cBio-Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018; 29625050), Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio-Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio-Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509, cBio-Jones et al., 2013; 23817572). A retrospective analysis of TCGA glioma samples reported elevated expression of ERBB3 correlated with PDGFRA expression and co-expression of these genes was an indicator of poor prognosis in a GBM patient cohort (Song et al., 2018; 29888103). Amplification of PDGFRA has been associated with tumor grade and poor progression-free and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma (Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). In addition, PDGFRA amplification has been reported to occur in conjunction with IDH1 mutation in glioblastoma, and both alterations in the same tumor have been associated with poor patient prognosis (Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). Amplification of PDGFRA has also been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or KIT amplification in glioblastomas, as well as with EGFR amplification (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383, Szerlip et al., 2012; 22323597). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence in solid tumors and hematologic cancers, PDGFRA activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to imatinib (Arefi et al., 2012; 22806436, Baccarani et al., 2007; 17666373, Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Chalmers et al., 2015; 25658984, Cools et al., 2003; 12660384, Curtis et al., 2007; 17555450, Debiec-Rychter et al., 2016; 15010069, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Florian et al., 2006; 16406018, Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816, Griffin et al., 2003; 12808148, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Helbig et al., 2009; 19120352, Helbig et al., 2014; 24009127, Hus et al., 2011; 21093052, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Intermesoli et al., 2009; 19735261, Jain et al., 2009; 19013640, Jovanovic et al., 2007; 17299092, Kang et al., 2012; 22150077, Klion et al., 2004; 14504092, Kobayashi et al., 2009; 19192229, Kocáková et al., 2014; 24635438, Metzgeroth et al., 2008; 18950453, Murayama et al., 2012; 22645636, Ogbogu et al., 2009; 19910029, Ohnishi et al., 2006; 16856885, Pardanani et al., 2003; 12842979, Pardanani et al., 2004; 15284118, Qu et al., 2016; 27120808, Score et al., 2006; 16498388, Shah et al., 2011; 24669761, Sugimoto et al., 2015; 26319757, Volz et al., 2011; 20609486, von Bubnoff et al., 2005; 15618966, Walz et al., 2006; 16845659, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666). Sorafenib has shown clinical and preclinical activity against the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) and mutations associated with clinical resistance to imatinib and sunitinib in both CEL and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)(Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P, Al-Riyami et al., 2013; 23157309, Lierman et al., 2006; 16645167, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337, Metzgeroth et al., 2012; 21818111, Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526, Von Bubnoff et al., 2011; 20972453). Complete responses to nilotinib have been reported in patients with CEL or hypereosinophilic syndrome with FIP1L1-PDGFRA or activating mutations (Hochhaus et al., 2013; 24057647, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Tabouret et al., 2011; 20832858); preclinical evidence has reported efficacy of nilotinib in the context of PDGFRA mutations associated with GIST (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Weisberg et al., 2006; 17087936). Patients with GIST harboring PDGFRA activating mutations have been reported to derive clinical benefit from treatment with sunitinib (Heinrich et al., 2006; ASCO Abstract 9502, Brohl et al., 2015; 26396737) or regorafenib (Grellety et al., 2015; 28031906, Kollar et al., 2014; 25905001). Preclinical studies have reported sensitivity of activating PDGFRA mutations and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion to dasatinib (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337). PDGFRA D842 mutations were reported to be sensitive to avapritinib in clinical (Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) and preclinical (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) studies of GIST, and demonstrated sensitivity to ripretinib for 1 patient (Jaku et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2515).</Interpretation>

On the basis of clinical responses in patients with GIST, PDGFRA activating mutations may predict sensitivity to sorafenib (Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P)(Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; Phase 2 studies of sorafenib plus temozolomide report limited activity in patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Zustovich et al., 2013; 23898124; Reardon et al., 2011; 20443129). A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib in patients with glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6 month progression-free survival (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651). A Phase 2 trial of sorafenib and erlotinib in glioblastoma also did not meet its primary endpoint, and erlotinib clearance was increased by the addition of sorafenib (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). In a Phase 1 trial in patients with high-grade glioma, the combination of sorafenib with radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) resulted in increased toxicity and did not result in significant improvement in clinical efficacy compared with RT and TMZ alone (Hottinger et al., 2014; 24786603). In a clinical study of sorafenib in pediatric patients with low-grade astrocytoma, one patient achieved a partial response (PR), one had stable disease (SD), and 9 patients had progressive disease; this study was terminated early due to unexpectedly high disease progression rates (Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

Please see the drug label for full prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gene Association:&lt;/b&gt; On the basis of strong clinical evidence, PDGFRA activating mutations (Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666), fusions (Baccarani et al., 2007; 17666373, Curtis et al., 2007; 17555450, Griffin et al., 2003; 12808148, Helbig et al., 2009; 19120352, Klion et al., 2004; 14504092, Qu et al., 2016; 27120808, Metzgeroth et al., 2007; 17377585, Metzgeroth et al., 2008; 18950453, Ogbogu et al., 2009; 19910029, Sugimoto et al., 2015; 26319757), and expression (Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816) may predict sensitivity to imatinib. On the basis of clinical and preclinical data in KIT-mutated (Carvajal et al., 2011; 21642685, Debiec-Rychter et al., 2006; 16624552, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Hodi et al., 2013; 23775962), KIT-amplified (Wei et al., 2019; 30075827, Guo et al., 2011; 21690468, Hodi et al., 2013; 23775962, Carvajal et al., 2011; 21642685), or KIT-expressing tumors (DeMatteo et al., 2009; 19303137, Faivre et al., 2005; 16135502, Alcedo et al., 2004; 15350030, Brandwein et al., 2011; 21403650, Hotte et al., 2005; 15659505, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263, Kamenz et al., 2006; 16570351, Wang et al., 2005; 15650049), KIT activating alterations may confer sensitivity to imatinib. PDGFRA amplification may predict sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib; a patient with Merkel cell carcinoma expressing PDGFRA achieved a complete response to imatinib (Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Data:&lt;/b&gt; In a clinical study where patients with recurrent glioblastoma were given imatinib, 2/24 patients achieved a PR, 10 patients reported SD, and median OS and PFS was observed to be 6.2 and 3 months, respectively (Hassler et al., 2014; 25674429). However, other Phase 2 clinical trials of imatinib have reported no anti-tumor activity, with a study of 231 patients with glioblastoma reporting a radiographic response rate of only 3.4% (Razis et al., 2009; 19789313, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263). In another Phase 2 study, imatinib plus hydroxyurea was shown to be well tolerated among patients with recurrent/progressive low-grade glioma, but had negligible antitumor activity (Reardon et al., 2012; 22371319). &lt;/p&gt;</Rationale>

              <Interpretation>PIK3CA encodes p110-alpha, which is the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples analyzed in the TCGA dataset (cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), and other studies report the incidence of PIK3CA mutations in primary GBMs as 5-18% (Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, El-Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study detected PIK3CA mutation in 16% (36/232) of IDH-wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 5-23% of high-grade gliomas (including glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) (El-Habr et al., 2010; 20569675, Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, Derakhshandeh-Peykar et al., 2011; 22026810, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). While another study did not observe PIK3CA mutations in low-grade astrocytomas or in anaplastic astrocytomas, it did report high ERK and AKT activity (El-Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study found that PIK3CA mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) was associated with shorter median PFS in both a discovery cohort (6.9 vs. 12.4 months, HR=2.89, p=0.01) and in the TCGA cohort (6.1 vs. 9 months, p=0.008), but was not consistently associated with median OS (Tanaka et al., 2019; 31036078). In a study of IDH-wildtype GBM, patients with alterations in PI3K class I genes (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3CG, and PIK3R2) had significantly longer OS (20.0 months altered vs. 16.9 months wildtype, HR=0.62, p=0.002) and PFS (11.0 months altered vs. 7.4 months wildtype, p=0.0043); patients with PIK3CA alterations experienced an improved OS but this association was not highly significant (20.0 months altered vs. 18.1 months wildtype, p=0.0407)(Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). The Phase 2 NCI-MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD &gt;6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA-mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA-mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA-mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA-mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23), but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA-mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002).</Interpretation>

              <ClinicalTrialNote>PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway. Strong clinical data support sensitivity of PIK3CA-mutated solid tumors to the PI3K-alpha inhibitor alpelisib.</ClinicalTrialNote>

              <Interpretation>CDKN2A encodes two different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes the tumor suppressor p15INK4b (Quelle et al., 1995; 8521522, Sharpless, 2005; 15878778). Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth-suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6-cyclin-Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio-Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio-Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (6%) (Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF-encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH-wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Clinical data in mesothelioma, breast cancer, and uterine leiomyosarcoma indicate that CDKN2A loss may predict sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fennell et al., 2022; 35157829) and palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889). However, multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma-astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>CDKN2C encodes p18, also known as INK4c, a member of a family of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitors. INK4 family members are commonly deleted in cancer, which results in unrestrained CDK4/6 activity and dysregulated cell cycle entry (Ortega et al., 2002; 11960696). CDKN2C alterations that result in loss or disruption of the ankyrin repeats (amino acids 4-132), are predicted to be inactivating (Venkataramani et al., 1998; 9437433, Li et al., 1999; 10074345), although some alterations seen in the context of cancer have not been directly functionally characterized. Although CDKN2C missense mutations are rare in the context of cancer, loss of p18INK4c expression, genomic loss, deletion, and promoter methylation have been frequently reported in Merkel cell carcinoma (Leonard et al., 2000; 11198276, Vortmeyer et al., 1998; 9576574), anaplastic meningioma (Leuraud et al., 2000; 11263500, Bostrom et al., 2001; 11485924, Santarius et al., 2000; 10736068), uterine leiomyomata (Christacos et al., 2006; 16320247), leiomyosarcoma (Williams et al., 2020; 33015533), pituitary adenoma (Hossain et al., 2010; 19401813, Kirsch et al., 2009; 18973139), Hodgkin lymphoma (Sanchez-Aguilera et al., 2004; 14645011), multiple myeloma (Leone et al., 2008; 18829482, Boyd et al., 2011; 21994415, Walker et al., 2010; 20616218), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Morishita et al., 2004; 15349907), adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary gland (Daa et al., 2008; 18254776), secondary angiosarcoma (Styring et al., 2014; 24983371), pancreatic carcinoma (Lindberg et al., 2008; 17803708, Liang et al., 2014; 25502777), gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Kim et al., 2014; 25036575), glioblastoma (Solomon et al., 2008; 18381405, Wiedemeyer et al., 2008; 18394558, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), Wilms tumors (Arcellana-Panlilio et al., 2000; 10918395), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (Hartman et al., 2010; 20421449, Flordal Thelander et al., 2007; 17161458, Bea et al., 2009; 18984860). CDKN2C alterations, including missense mutations, have also been reported in parathyroid adenomas (Tahara et al., 1997; 9286748, Costa-Guda et al., 2013; 23715670, Gluick et al., 2013; 24127162) and thyroid carcinomas (TCs) (van Veelen et al., 2009; 18942719, Pita et al., 2014; 24423316, Kunstman et al., 2015; 25576899); single nucleotide polymorphisms within the region encoding CDKN2C have been associated with increased risk of papillary TC (Neta et al., 2011; 21642358) and with increased tumor size in sporadic medullary TC (Barbieri et al., 2014; 25565272). CDKN2C alterations or loss of p18INK4c expression are negative prognostic factors in multiple myeloma (Leone et al., 2008; 18829482, Boyd et al., 2011; 21994415, Walker et al., 2010; 20616218), HCC (Morishita et al., 2004; 15349907), MCL (Hartman et al., 2010; 20421449), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Hattori et al., 2006; 16651240). However, p18INK4c has been reported to be overexpressed in mesothelioma (Romagnoli et al., 2009; 19218339), and nuclear p18INK4c expression has been reported to be a poor prognostic factor in oligodendroglioma (Korshunov and Golanov, 2002; 11800646). On the basis of preclinical studies, CDKN2C inactivation may promote sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors (Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Wiedemeyer et al., 2010; 20534551, Eguchi et al., 2009; 19509251, Jalili et al., 2012; 22997239), although this has not been demonstrated clinically.</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>HGF encodes hepatocyte growth factor, also known as scatter factor, an activating ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Certain splice isoforms of HGF may also act as MET antagonists (Stamos et al., 2004; 15167892, Tolbert et al., 2010; 20624990). HGF plays an important role in normal development, acting as a growth factor in a number of different tissues (Stamos et al., 2004; 15167892, Tolbert et al., 2010; 20624990). HGF and its receptor, MET, have been implicated in growth, invasion, and metastasis of many solid tumors (Tolbert et al., 2010; 20624990). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. Characterized HGF mutations have rarely been reported in solid tumors (cBio-Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359, Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). HGF expression within tumor glioma cells is associated with high-grade glioma and increased microvessels, and tumor-derived HGF expression has been shown to correlate with reduced survival time (Guo et al., 2012; 22741575). Elevated expression of HGF and MET mRNA have been reported in GBM (Garnett et al., 2013; 23359207, Kunkel et al., 2001; 11296484), and HGF expression in GBM models has been shown to be associated with responsiveness to MET inhibition (Zhang et al., 2013; 23386689). On the basis of several preclinical studies in different cancer types, high HGF gene expression may associate with sensitivity to MET-targeted therapies, such as the approved multikinase inhibitors crizotinib and cabozantinib (Zhang et al., 2013; 23386689, Xie et al., 2012; 22203985, Kentsis et al., 2012; 22683780, Qian et al., 2013; 24167653, Wanjala et al., 2015; 25381262). However, this hypothesis has not been extensively tested in clinical studies. Whereas patients with glioblastoma and high tumor HGF gene expression experienced longer survival and a higher objective response rate (5/14 vs. 0/16) on the MET-targeting antibody onartuzumab combined with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab than with placebo plus bevacizumab (Cloughesy et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2015), tumor HGF gene expression did not predict significant benefit from onartuzumab added to the EGFR-inhibitor erlotinib for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (Koeppen et al., 2014; 24687921). Anti-HGF antibodies, such as ficlatuzumab, are also under clinical investigation (Patnaik et al., 2014; 24901237, Iveson et al., 2014; 24965569). It is unclear if missense mutations in HGF may lead to increased expression or activation, and therefore it is unknown whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant.</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite-stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low-level MSI has been reported in 5-9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large-scale study did not find high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small-scale study reported MSI-H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI-H tumors to respond to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI-H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non-MSI-H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO-SITC Abstract P60).</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>PI3K signaling is implicated in the regulation of metabolic control, immunity, angiogenesis and cardiovascular homeostasis, and is one of the most frequently dysregulated pathways in cancer. In contrast to class I PI3Ks, including p110-alpha and p110-beta, the functional roles of class II PI3Ks, encoded by PIK3C2A, PIK3C2B, and PIK3C2G, are not well understood (Biswas et al., 2013; 23192342). Although PIK3C2B mutation has not been reported for many tumor types, microarray analysis of glioblastoma cell lines revealed that increased gene expression of PIK3C2B significantly correlated with insensitivity to erlotinib (Low et al., 2008; 19189657). In addition, 8% of 465 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor samples analyzed in one study demonstrated copy number amplification of PIK3C2B (Rao et al., 2010; 19609742). Although elevated expression of PIK3C2B has been observed in GBM, it is unclear if this plays any role in oncogenesis. There are no therapies known to effectively target mutations in PIK3C2B.</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT, or hTERT) is a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, which is required to maintain appropriate chromosomal length (Shay et al., 2011; 22015685). Activation of TERT is a hallmark of cancer, being detected in up to 80-90% of malignancies and absent in quiescent cells (Shay et al., 1997; 9282118, Kim et al., 1994; 7605428, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; 10647931). Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at -124 bp and -146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions –124/–125 bp and –138/–139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT promoter mutations have been reported in 51-59% of gliomas (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048), most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM, 54-84%), gliosarcoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (78%), and historically in oligoastrocytomas (25-31%) but less frequently in lower grade astrocytomas (10-18%) and in only 1% of ependymomas (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Liu et al., 2013; 23603989, Koelsche et al., 2013; 24154961, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048). In patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the prevalence of TERT promoter mutation is lower in pediatric primary GBM (11%) and adult secondary GBM (28%) compared with adult primary GBM (58-83%) (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248). One study detected TERT promoter mutations in 78% (181/232) of IDH-wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, although this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH-positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH-wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor-associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide- or peptide-based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti-CTLA-4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395). A Phase 2 study of the TERT inhibitor imetelstat for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer reported no improvement in PFS or OS (Chiappori et al., 2015; 25467017). TERT mutations are associated with 1p/19q co-deletion in oligodendrogliomas, and are highly recurrent in IDH/ATRX-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2-wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).</Interpretation>

              <Interpretation>Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein-coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide-based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD-1- or PD-L1-targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya-Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (&gt;20 muts/Mb)(FMI-Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high-grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti-PD-L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti-PD-1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya-Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti-PD-1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti-PD-L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.</Interpretation>
