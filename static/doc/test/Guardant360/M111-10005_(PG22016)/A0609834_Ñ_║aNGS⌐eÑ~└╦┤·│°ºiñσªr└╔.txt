Analytical sensitivity :
For SNVs, indels, including CDx variants and for CNAs, the Guardant360 LoD was established by combining cfDNA from clinical plasma samples from multiple 
cancers to create pools of material comprising multiple known alterations. For fusions, the Guardant360 LoD was established using cfDNA from cell lines 
with known fusions titrated into wild-type (WT) cfDNA from clinical plasma samples.
At 30ng input, LOD for SNVs 0.2% MAF, Indels 0.2% MAF, Fusions 0.1-0.2% MAF, CNVs 2.3-2.4 copies. Reportable range for SNVs 0.04% MAF, Indels 0.04% MAF, Fusions 0.04% MAF, CNVs 2.18 copies.



Methodology: 
Guardant360 sequences 74 cancer-associated genes to identify somatic alterations. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is extracted from plasma, enriched 
for targeted regions, and sequenced using the Illumina platform and hg19 as the reference genome. All exons are sequenced in some genes; 
only clinically significant exons are sequenced in other genes. The types of genomic alterations detected by Guardant360 include single 
nucleotide variants, gene amplifications, fusions, short insertions/deletions (longest detected, 70 base pairs), and splice site disrupting events 
(see Table 1). Microsatellite Instability (MSI) is assessed for all cancer types by evaluating somatic changes in the length of repetitive 
sequences on the Guardant360 panel.


Procedure:
Somatic alterations were detected in the circulating cell-free DNA isolated from this patient's blood specimen. These genomic alterations are 
cancer-associated somatic variants, some of which have been associated with either increased or reduced clinical response to specific 
treatments. The percentage of altered cell-free DNA circulating (% cfDNA) in blood is related to the unique tumor biology of each patient. 
Factors that may affect the % cfDNA of detected somatic alterations include tumor growth, turn over, size, heterogeneity, vascularization, 
disease progression, and treatment.
