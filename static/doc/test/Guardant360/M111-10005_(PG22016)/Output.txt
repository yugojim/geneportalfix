Definitions
 The functional consequences and/or clinical significance of alterations are unknown. Relevance of Variants of Uncertain Clinical Significance:
therapies targeting these alterations is uncertain.
Interpretation
Somatic alterations were detected in the circulating cell-free DNA isolated from this patient's blood specimen. These genomic alterations are 
cancer-associated somatic variants, some of which have been associated with either increased or reduced clinical response to specific 
treatments. The percentage of altered cell-free DNA circulating (% cfDNA) in blood is related to the unique tumor biology of each patient. 
Factors that may affect the % cfDNA of detected somatic alterations include tumor growth, turn over, size, heterogeneity, vascularization, 
disease progression, and treatment.DOB: OCT-25-1947 | Test Number 127424460, Cheng (A0609834)

Method and Limitations
Guardant360 sequences 74 cancer-associated genes to identify somatic alterations. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is extracted from plasma, enriched 
for targeted regions, and sequenced using the Illumina platform and hg19 as the reference genome. All exons are sequenced in some genes; 
only clinically significant exons are sequenced in other genes. The types of genomic alterations detected by Guardant360 include single 
nucleotide variants, gene amplifications, fusions, short insertions/deletions (longest detected, 70 base pairs), and splice site disrupting events 
(see Table 1). Microsatellite Instability (MSI) is assessed for all cancer types by evaluating somatic changes in the length of repetitive 
sequences on the Guardant360 panel. A "Not Detected" result in samples where the highest % cfDNA is < 0.2% is an inconclusive result 
because it does not preclude MSI-High status in tissue. MSI status is currently not reported for earlier panel versions. This version of the 
Guardant360 test is not validated for the detection of other types of genomic alterations, such as complex rearrangements or gene deletions. 
Certain sample or variant characteristics, such as low cfDNA concentration, may result in reduced analytic sensitivity. Guardant360 cannot 
discern the source of circulating cfDNA, and for some variants in the range of ~40 to 60% cfDNA, the test cannot easily distinguish germline 
variants from somatic alterations. Guardant360 is not validated for the detection of germline or de novo variants that are associated with 
hereditary cancer risk. Tissue genotyping should be considered when plasma genotyping is negative, if clinically appropriate.
Table 1: Genes on the Guardant360 Panel
Guardant360 reports single nucleotide variants, splice site mutations, and insertion and deletion variants (indels) in all clinically relevant exons in 74 genes and reports 
other variant types in select genes as indicated below.
  ‡ Guardant360 reports alterations in the promoter region of this gene. # Guardant360 reports fusion events involving this gene.
† Guardant360 reports amplifications of this gene.
 
About the Test
The Guardant360 assay was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by Guardant Health, Inc. This test has not been 
cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not 
necessary. This test may be used for clinical purposes and should not be regarded as investigational or for research only. Guardant Health's

complexity clinical laboratory testing. The laboratory report should be interpreted in the context of other clinical information and laboratory, 
pathology, and imaging studies by a qualified medical professional prior to initiating or changing a patient's treatment plan. The selection of 
any, all, or none of the drugs associated with potential clinical benefit (or potential lack of clinical benefit) is entirely at the discretion of the 
treating medical professional. Drug and trial information are based on the diagnosis written on the submitted test request form; this
