VARIANT IN TERPRETATION  
SMARCA4  R978*  
Biological Impact  
The SWI/SNF -related, matrix -associated, actin -dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4 (SMARCA4) 
gene encodes an ATP -dependent helicase, a catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex which 
play a role in gene transcription, DNA synthesis and DNA repair[1][2][3]. SMARCA4 has been implicated as a 
haploinsufficient gene as demonstrated by the development of mammary tumors in SMARCA4 heterozygous mice[4]. 
SMARCA4 is the most freque ntly mutated gene among the SWI/SNF subunits and its inactivation bas been implicated 
in malignant rhabdoid tumors, lymphoma, medulloblastoma, lung and ovarian cancer[5][6][7]. Germline mutations in the 
SMARCA4 gene predispose carriers to pediatric atypica l teratoid/ rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT)[6][7][8]and small cell 
carcinoma of the ovary of hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT)[9][10][11]. 
 
R978* mutation results in a premature truncation of the SMARCA4 protein at amino acid 978 (UniProtKB). This mutation 
is predicted to lead to a loss of SMARCA4 function, despite not having characterized in the literature.  
 
Therapeutic and prognostic relevance  
Results of in vitro and in vivo preclinical models showed that SMARCA2 - and SMARCA4 -deficient small -cell carcinoma 
of the ovar y hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) were sensitive to the inhibitor of the H3K27 histone methyltransferase 
(EZH2), tazemetostat[12]. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy of tazemetostat in patients with SMARCA4 
loss or mutation (NCT03155620, NCT 03213665, and NCT02601950).  
 
Low SMARCA4  expression is a significant prognostic biomarker to predict increased sensitivity to cisplatin and 
vinorelbine combination chemotherapy in non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients[13]. Loss or reduced expression 
of SMARCA4 and SMARCB1 in triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and patients correlated with poor 
response to doxorubicin -containing regimen (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide)[14]. 
 
ATM Heterozygous deletion  
Biological Impact  
The ataxia -telangiec tasia mutated protein kinase (ATM) gene encodes a PI3K -related serine/threonine protein kinase 
involved in genomic integrity maintenance and plays central roles in DNA double -strand break (DSB) repair, which can 
be induced by ionizing radiation, chemothera py drugs, or oxidative stress[15]. ATM is a well -characterized tumor 
suppressor gene, hereditary mutations and haploinsufficiency of ATM result in markedly increased susceptibility to a 
variety of cancer types[16][17][18][19][20]. Results from a case -cohor t study of colorectal cancer and cancer -free control 
individuals suggested that germline pathogenic mutations in ATM and PALB2 should be added to established CRC risk 
genes as part of standard tumor genetic testing panels[21]. ATM is among the most commonl y aberrant genes in sporadic 
cancers. Somatic ATM aberrations are frequently observed in hematologic malignancies[22][23][24][25]and a board range 
of tumors such as prostate cancer[26], head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)[27], pancreatic cancer[28], lung 
adenocarcinoma[29], breast cancer[30], and ovarian cancer[17]. 
 
Therapeutic and prognostic relevance  
In May 2020, the U.S. FDA approved olaparib for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration -resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) who c arry mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes, including BRCA1, 
BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, RAD54L, and 
progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate ( NCT02987543)[31]. 
 
In a phase II trial (TOPARP -A; NCT01682772), 3 out of 4 metastatic prostate cancer patients harboring only ATM 
inactivating mutations responded to olaparib treatment[32]. Also, the phase II TOPARP -B trial (NCT01682772) 
demonstrated that olaparib treatment resulted in a RECIST 1.1 or PSA50 response rate of 10.5% (2/12) and a TW21070020320221115 142301

composite overall response rate of 36.8% (7/19) in prostate cancer patients harboring deleterious ATM mutations[33].In 
another randomized, double -blind phase II trial in Asian patients with metastatic gastric cancer has shown that addition 
of olaparib to paclitaxel significantly increased the OS in both the overall population and patients with low or 
undetectable ATM protein expression (NCT01063517)[34]. However, in the  subsequent phase III trial (GOLD; 
NCT01924533), addition of olaparib to paclitaxel did not significantly improve OS in the overall or the ATM -negative 
population of Asian gastric cancer patients[35]. Besides, in a phase II trial (TBCRC 048; NCT03344965), 7 metastatic 
breast cancer patients harboring only ATM mutations were not responded to olaparib treatment (SD: n=2, PD: n=5)[36].In 
a phase II trial (TRITON2; NCT02952534), 49 mCRPC patients harboring ATM alteration had limited response to 
rucaparib treatm ent. The radiographic response rate was 10.5 % (n=2/19 evaluable patients), the prostate -specific 
antigen response rate was 4.1% (n=2/49), and the 6 -month clinical benefit rate was 28.6% (n=12/42)[37]. 
 
In preclinical studies, cells with ATM alternation we re sensitive to olaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib treatment in vitro 
and in vivo[38][39][40][41]. 
 
In addition, ATM has been determined as an inclusion criterion for the trials evaluating olaparib efficacy in breast cancer 
(NCT04053322) and advanced sol id tumors (NCT03297606), rucaparib efficacy in ovarian cancer 
(NCT01968213)[42]and prostate cancer (NCT02952534, NCT03533946)[37], niraparib efficacy in pancreatic cancer 
(NCT03553004, NCT03601923), prostate cancer (NCT02854436), melanoma (NCT03925350), me tastatic 
esophageal/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)/proximal gastric adenocarcinoma (NCT03840967), and any malignancy, 
except prostate (NCT03207347), and talazoparib efficacy in advanced or metastatic cancer (NCT02286687), HER2 -
negative solid tumors (NCT02 401347), prostate cancer (NCT03148795), and lung cancer (NCT03377556), respectively.  
 
Also, a prospective study in muscle -invasive bladder cancer patients suggested that genomic alternations in the DNA 
repair genes ATMs, RB1 and FANCC could be recognized as biomarkers predictive of response to cisplatin -based 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy[43]. However, loss -of-function of the ATM -CHEK2 -TP53 cascade is associated with 
resistance to anthracycline/mitomycin -containing chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer[44]. 
 
A retrospective study of VICTOR trial demonstrated that ATM loss was associated with worse prognosis in colorectal 
cancer[45]. 
 
CHEK1  Heterozygous deletion  
Biological Impact  
The checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1 or CHK1) gene encodes a protein kinase involved  in transducing DNA damage signals 
and is required for both the intra -S phase and G2/M checkpoints[46]. CHEK1 heterozygosity has been shown to cause 
haploinsufficient phenotypes that can contribute to tumorigenesis through inappropriate S phase entry, accu mulation 
of DNA damage during replication, and failure to restrain mitotic entry[47][48]. Despite acting as a tumor suppressor, 
homozygous loss -of-function mutations in CHEK1 have not been identified in tumors[49], and CHEK1 mutations are 
extremely rare[46]. Overexpression of CHEK1 has been observed in a variety of tumors, including liver cancer[50], breast 
cancer[51], colorectal cancer[52], non -small cell lung (NSCLC) cancer[53], and nasopharyngeal cancer[54]. 
 
Therapeutic and prognostic relevance  
In May 2 020, the U.S. FDA approved olaparib for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration -resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) who carry mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes, including BRCA1, 
BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1 , CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, RAD54L, and 
progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate (NCT02987543)[31]. 
 
In addition, CHEK1 has been determined as an inclusion criterion for the trials evaluating olaparib  efficacy in advanced 
solid tumors (NCT03297606; CAPTUR trial), rucaparib efficacy in ovarian cancer (NCT01968213)[42], prostate cancer 
(NCT03533946), niraparib efficacy in pancreatic cancer (NCT03553004), and any malignancy, except prostate TW21070020320221115 142301

Selective inhibitors for CHEK1 and CHEK2 alone or in combination with other agents are currently being investigated 
in clinical trials[55]. 
 
FBXW7  Heterozygous deletion  
Biological Impac t 
The F -box/WD repeat -containing protein 7 (FBXW7) gene encodes a protein that belongs to the SCF (SKP1 -CUL1 -F-
box protein) E3 ligase complex. FBXW7 is recognized as a tumor suppressor which is involved in the negative 
regulation of oncogenes such as c -Myc[56][57], c-Jun[58], cyclin E[59], Notch family members[60][61], Aurora -A[62], mTOR[63], 
KLF5[64], and MCL -1[65]. Inactivating FBXW7 mutation or copy number loss may result in the accumulation of 
oncoproteins and therefore lead to malignant transformation[66]. FBXW7 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene 
with one copy loss may lead to weak protein expression and is insufficient to execute its original physiological 
functions[64][65][67]. 
 
Therapeutic and prognostic relevance  
Clinical efficacy of mTOR inhibitors was seen in patients harboring aberrations in the FBXW7 gene (one patient with 
refractory fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, and one patient with lung adenocarcinoma)[68][69]. Moreover, in vitro 
assay also suggested that loss or inactivatio n of FBXW7 may confer sensitivity to mTOR inhibitor[63]. 
 
Preclinical studies suggested that mutations or loss of FBXW7 were associated with regorafenib and oxaliplatin 
resistance in CRC cell lines and gefitinib resistance in lung cancer cells[70][71][72][ 73]. 
 
Retrospective studies have indicated that a relatively low expression level of FBXW7 is an independent prognostic 
marker of poor survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell 
carcinoma[74][72]. 
 
MRE11  Heterozygous deletion  
Biological Impact  
The MRE11 gene encodes a protein that forms the MRE11 -RAD50 -NBS (MRN) complex involved in sensing and 
repairing DNA double -strand breaks via homologous recombination and non -homologous end joining[75][76]. MRE11 has  
been implicated as a haploinsufficient gene with one copy loss may lead to weak protein expression and is insufficient 
to execute its original physiological function[75]. The carrier of MRE11 mutation may confer elevated risks for numerous 
types of cancer s including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, and lymphoid 
cancer[75][76][77][78][79][80][81]. 
 
Therapeutic and prognostic relevance  
In a Phase II clinical trial (n=50), one castration -resistant prostate cancer patient h arboring an MRE11 inactivating 
mutation responded to olaparib[32]. Preclinically, loss of MRE11 also predicted sensitivity to PARP inhibitor talazoparib 
and ABT -888 in endometrial cancer[82]and microsatellite unstable colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines[83]. MRE11 has 
been selected as an inclusion criterion for the trial examining olaparib in metastatic biliary tract cancer (NCT04042831), 
and talazoparib in HER2 -negative breast cancer (NCT02401347) and prostate cancer (NCT03148795).  
 
CRC patients with tumor deficient of MRE11 showed initially reduced disease -free survival (DFS) and overall survival 
(OS) but improved long -term DFS and OS compared with patients with an intact MRE11[84].

PTEN  Homozygous deletion  
Biological Impact  
The phosphatase and tensin hom olog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) gene encodes a lipid/protein phosphatase 
that is important for the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, homologous recombination and maintenance of genomic 
integrity[85][86]. PTEN acts as an essential tumor supp ressor by antagonizing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway[87]. 
PTEN is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene, in which having only one copy of the wild -type allele does not 
produce enough protein product to execute wild -type functions[88][89][90]. Ger mline loss -of-function PTEN mutations are 
found in approximately 80% of patients with Cowden syndrome, a disorder that is associated with high -penetrance 
breast and thyroid cancer[91][92][93]. Somatic mutations or monoallelic loss of PTEN is regularly obse rved in a significant 
fraction of human cancers, including sporadic breast cancer, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, and 
glioblastoma[94][95][96][97][98]. 
 
Therapeutic and prognostic relevance  
Somatic loss of PTEN results in aberrant activ ation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and provides a mechanistic 
rationale for PI3K pathway inhibitors treatment[99][100]. Preclinical studies demonstrated that PTEN deficiency was 
associated with increased sensitivity to PI3K pathway inhibitors in sele cted cancer subtypes[101][102][103][104][105][106]. 
Although early clinical data indicated that PTEN loss was associated with improved response and survival in solid tumor 
patients treated with mTORC1 inhibitor, everolimus[107][108][109], several phase II trials showed no clinical benefit of 
everolimus or temsirolimus treatment in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring PTEN loss[110][111][112]. 
 
Several groups found that PTEN loss was generally associated with poor response to trastuzumab therapy, wh ether 
this agent was administered in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic settings[113][114][115][116][117]. Also, loss of PTEN 
expression in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) has been linked with resistance to anti -EGFR mAbs like cetuximab 
and panitumu mab[118][119][120][121][122][123].Preclinical studies showed that loss of PTEN expression in EGFR mutant cells 
was associated with decreased sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, erlotinib and gefitinib[124][125]. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
signal pathway has bee n shown to be an effective strategy to radiosensitize NSCLC cells harboring the EGFR activating 
mutation that acquires resistance to both TKIs due to PTEN loss or inactivation mutations[126].Loss or biallelic 
inactivation of PTEN is associated with resista nce to anti -PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapies, including 
pembrolizumab and nivolumab in melanoma and leiomyosarcoma patients[127][128][129]. 
 
PTEN loss of function mutation has been determined as an inclusion criterion for the trial evaluating olaparib ef ficacy 
in metastatic biliary tract cancer (NCT04042831); talazoparib efficacy in HER2 -negative solid tumors (NCT02401347); 
rucaparib efficacy in prostate cancer (NCT02952534, NCT03533946), and niraparib efficacy in breast cancer 
(NCT04508803) or any malign ancy (except prostate) cancer (NCT03207347). Clinical data also suggested that PTEN 
deficient cancers may be sensitive to olaparib[130]. However, in a phase II trial (NCT02286687), 13 patients with 
advanced solid tumors harboring PTEN mutation or loss (by IHC) had limited response to talazoparib treatment; only 
one patient with PTEN mutation had prolonged SD (Mol Cancer Ther 2018;17(1 Suppl):Abstract nr A096; 
NCT02286687). Besides, in a phase I trial (NCT00749502), no association between loss of PTEN expres sion and the 
efficacy of niraparib was identified in patients with castration -resistant prostate cancer[131]. 
 
In a preclinical study, PTEN null cancer cells were sensitive to rucaparib treatment in vitro[132].

LIMITATIONS  
1. This test does not provide information of variant causality and does not detect variants in non -coding regions that could affect 
gene expression. This report does not report polymorphisms and we do not classify whether a mutation is germline or somatic.  
Variants identified by this assay were not s ubject to validation by Sanger or other technologies.  
2. The possibility cannot be excluded that certain pathogenic variants detected by other sequencing tools may not be reported in  
the test because of technical limitation of bioinformatics algorithm or the NGS sequencing platform, e.g. low coverage.  
3. This test has been designed to detect fusions in 13 genes sequenced. Therefore, fusion in genes not covered by this test woul d 
not be reported. For novel fusions detected in this test, Sanger sequencing confirmat ion is recommended if residue specimen 
is available.

NEXT -GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS) METHODS  
DNA test  
Extracted genomic DNA was amplified using primers targeting coding exons of analyzed genes and subjected to library construct ion. 
Barcoded libraries were  subsequently conjugated with sequencing beads by emulsion PCR and enriched using Ion Chef system. 
Sequencing was performed according to Ion Proton or Ion S5 sequencer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  
 
Raw reads generated by the sequencer were mapped t o the hg19 reference genome using the Ion Torrent Suite. Coverage depth 
was calculated using Torrent Coverage Analysis plug -in. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions/deletions (InDels) 
were identified using the Torrent Variant Caller plug -in. VEP (Variant Effect Predictor) was used to annotate every variant using 
databases from Clinvar, COSMIC and Genome Aggregation database. Variants with coverage ≥ 20, allele frequency ≥ 5% and 
actionable variants with allele frequency ≥ 2% were retained.  This test provides uniform coverage of the targeted regions, enabling 
target base coverage at 100x ≥ 85% with a mean coverage ≥ 500x. 
 
Variants reported in Genome Aggregation database with > 1% minor allele frequency (MAF) were considered as polymorphisms . ACT 
Genomics in -house database was used to determine technical errors. Clinically actionable and biologically significant variants were 
determined based on the published medical literature.  
 
The copy number alterations (CNAs) were predicted as described below:  
Amplicons with read counts in the lowest 5th percentile of all detectable amplicons and amplicons with a coefficient of varia tion ≥ 0.3 
were removed. The remaining amplicons were normalized to correct the pool design bias. ONCOCNV (an established me thod for 
calculating copy number aberrations in amplicon sequencing data by Boeva et al., 2014) was applied for the normalization of t otal 
amplicon number, amplicon GC content, amplicon length, and technology -related biases, followed by segmenting the samp le with a 
gene -aware model. The method was used as well for establishing the baseline of copy number variations.  
 
Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was calculated by using the sequenced regions of ACTOnco®+ to estimate the number of somatic 
nonsynonymous mutat ions per megabase of all protein -coding genes (whole exome). The TMB calculation predicted somatic variants 
and applied a machine learning model with a cancer hotspot correction. TMB may be reported as “TMB -High”, “TMB -Low” or “Cannot 
Be Determined ”. TMB -High corresponds to ≥ 7.5 mutations per megabase (Muts/Mb); TMB -Low corresponds to < 7.5 Muts/Mb. TMB 
is reported as “Cannot Be Determined ” if the tumor purity of the sample is < 30%. 
 
Classification of microsatellite instability (MSI) status is determined by a machine learning prediction algorithm. The change of a 
number of repeats of different lengths from a pooled microsatellite stable (MSS) baseline in > 400 genomic loci are used as t he 
features for the algorithm. The final output of the results is eithe r microsatellite Stable (MSS) or microsatellite instability high (MSI -H). 
 
RNA test  
Extracted RNA was reverse -transcribed and subjected to library construction. Sequencing was performed according to Ion Proton or 
Ion S5 sequencer protocol (Thermo Fisher Sc ientific). To ensure sequencing quality for fusion variant analysis, the average unique 
RNA Start Sites (SS) per control Gene Specific Primer 2 (GSP 2) should be ≥ 10. 
 
The fusion analysis pipeline aligned sequenced reads to the human reference genome, ide ntified regions that map to noncontiguous 
regions of the genome, applied filters to exclude probable false -positive events and, annotated previously characterized fusion events 
according to Quiver Gene Fusion Database, a curated database owned and maintain ed by ArcherDX. In general, samples with 
detectable fusions need to meet the following criteria: (1) Number of unique start sites (SS) for the GSP2 ≥ 3; (2) Number of supporting 
reads spanning the fusion junction ≥ 5; (3) Percentage of supporting reads spa nning the fusion junction ≥ 10%; (4) Fusions annotated 
in Quiver Gene Fusion Database.
