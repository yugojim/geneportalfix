Mutation, loss, or inactivation of ARID1A has been reported in many cancers, and the gene is considered a tumor suppressor (Guan et al., 2011; 21900401, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Yan et al., 2014; 24293408, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Huang et al., 2012; 22922871, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209). ARID1A mutations, which are mostly truncating, have been identified along the entire gene and often correlate with ARID1A protein loss (Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Zang et al., 2012; 22484628, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554), whereas ARID1A missense mutations are mostly uncharacterized. ARID1A alterations are particularly prevalent in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (46_50%), ovarian and uterine endometrioid carcinomas (24_44%), and cholangiocarcinoma (27%); they are also reported in up to 27% of gastric carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, pediatric Burkitt lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma samples analyzed (COSMIC, cBioPortal, 2023) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Wu et al., 2014; 24618703, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Streppel et al., 2013; 23318448, Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). ARID1A loss is associated with microsatellite instability in ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), CRC (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), and gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). Several studies have reported no correlation between ARID1A loss and clinicopathological parameters in ovarian clear cell or endometrioid carcinomas or other endometrial cancers (Rahman et al., 2013; 22939958, Maeda et al., 2010; 21614196, Lowery et al., 2012; 22193641, Fadare et al., 2013; 23524907), whereas others suggest that ARID1A loss is a negative prognostic factor (Mao et al., 2013; 24076775, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352). There are no therapies approved to address the mutation or loss of ARID1A in cancer. However, on the basis of limited clinical and preclinical evidence, ARID1A inactivating mutations may lead to sensitivity to ATR inhibitors such as M6620 and ceralasertib (Williamson et al., 2016; 27958275). In a Phase 2 study of ceralasertib in solid tumors, 2 patients with endometrial carcinoma in the cohort with loss of ARID1A expression achieved CRs on ceralasertib monotherapy; at least 1 of these 2 patients carried an inactivating ARID1A mutation. In contrast, no responses were observed for patients with normal ARID1A expression treated with ceralasertib combined with olaparib (Aggarwal et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 512O). One patient with small cell lung cancer harboring an ARID1A mutation experienced a PR when treated with M6620 combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124). In a Phase 1 trial, a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) harboring both an ARID1A mutation and ATM loss treated with single_agent M6620 achieved a CR that was ongoing at 29 months (Yap et al., 2020; 32568634). On the basis of limited clinical and preclinical evidence, ARID1A inactivation may predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors (Papadopoulos et al., 2022; ENA Abstract 188, Bitler et al., 2015; 25686104, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009). A Phase 1 study of EZH2 inhibitor CPI_0209 reported 1 PR for a patient with ARID1A_mutated endometrial cancer (Papadopoulos et al., 2022; ENA Abstract 188). Other studies have reported that the loss of ARID1A may activate the PI3K_AKT pathway and be linked with sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Wiegand et al., 2014; 24559118, Huang et al., 2014; 24336158, Samartzis et al., 2014; 24979463). Patients with ARID1A alterations in advanced or metastatic solid tumors may derive benefit from treatment with anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy (Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). Loss of ARID1A expression has been associated with chemoresistance to platinum_based therapy for patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Yokoyama et al., 2014; 24459582, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352) and to 5_fluorouracil in CRC cell lines (Xie et al., 2014; 24833095).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.

Loss of functional ATM promotes tumorigenesis (Cremona and Behrens, 2014; 23851492). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt ATM function or expression (Jiang et al., 2006; 16603769, Fernandes et al., 2005; 15713674, Scott et al., 2002; 11805335). ATM mutations have been reported in up to 1.3% of ovarian serous carcinoma samples analyzed (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365). In another study of patients with peritoneal, Fallopian tube, or ovarian carcinoma, somatic loss_of_function mutations in ATM have been found in 3/367 cases (Pennington et al., 2014; 24240112). The homologous recombination pathway has been reported to be disrupted in over 50% of high_grade serous ovarian cancer cases analyzed, including ATM or ATR mutations in 2% of tumors sampled (Colombo et al., 2013; 24071502, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365). A lack of ATM protein expression was reported in 11.3% of ovarian serous carcinomas, but this ATM deficiency was not significantly correlated with clinicopathological features (Ye at al., 2014; 24752797). ATM protein expression was found in 46.2% (79/171) of sporadic ovarian carcinomas analyzed in one study; the authors suggest that this may be compensatory expression in homologous recombination deficient cancer cells (Wysham et al., 2012; 22253870). In one study, high expression of ATM protein significantly correlated with poor progression_free survival in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinomas (Abdel_Fatah et al., 2014; 26674120). Loss of functional ATM results in a defective DNA damage response and homologous recombination_mediated DNA repair and may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Michels et al., 2014; 24037533, Bryant and Helleday, 2006; 16556909). Clinical responses have been reported for patients with ATM_mutated prostate cancer treated with PARP inhibitors (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, de Bono et al., 2020; ASCO GU Abstract 119, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346) and PARP inhibitors have shown limited clinical benefit for patients with other ATM_mutated solid tumors including pancreatic cancer (Ma et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 563, Dhawan et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3513), colorectal cancer (Ma et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 563, Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Papageorgiou et al., 2021; 35004311), papillary renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), ovarian cancer (Swisher et al., 2021; 33941784), small cell bowel cancer, (Dhawan et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3513), and biliary tract cancer (Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract A096, Zhang et al., 2020; 32045060). In Phase 1 trials of ATR inhibitors, a heavily pretreated patient with colorectal cancer who achieved a CR to berzosertib (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504) and 4 out of 4 patients with diverse solid tumors who achieved PRs to BAY1895344 (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960) harbored ATM inactivation or protein loss. In a Phase 2 study of a combination of the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib and durvalumab for patients with advanced gastric cancer, objective responses (ORs) were experienced by 50% (4/8) of patients with loss of ATM expression, compared with 14% (3/21) patients with intact ATM (Kwon et al., 2022; 35790315). Studies showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage in preclinical models of solid tumors (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Vendetti et al., 2015; 26517239, Min et al., 2017; 28138034) and hematologic malignancies (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132) also support the increased sensitivity of ATM_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. Preclinical experiments also indicate that loss of ATM causes dependency on DNA_PKcs in cancer cells; DNA_PKcs inhibitors promoted apoptosis in ATM_deficient cells and were active in a lymphoma mouse model lacking ATM activity (Riabinska et al., 2013; 23761041). Alterations in DNA repair genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK1, CHEK2, FAM175A, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D have been reported to be predictive for sensitivity to platinum agents and improved OS in Stage 2_4 ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinomas (p=0.0006)(Pennington et al., 2014; 24240112). One or more of the ATM variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with ataxia_telangiectasia syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. ATM mutation carriers have increased cancer risk, with carriers assigned female at birth displaying a 38% lifetime risk of breast cancer (van Os et al., 2016; 26662178). Biallelic mutations in ATM underlie the rare autosomal_recessive inherited disorder ataxia_telangiectasia (A_T), also referred to as genome instability or DNA damage response syndrome (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). This disease is characterized by genomic instability, sensitivity to DNA_damaging agents, and increased risk of developing cancer (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013; 23847781, Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). The prevalence of A_T is estimated at 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 worldwide (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of ATM is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Loss or inactivation of ATM may increase sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, ATR inhibitors, or DNA_PKcs inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT05489211", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04434482", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04884360", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04518501", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04517357", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05489926", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03983226", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05652283", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03742895", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MSI_High", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MSI_High"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample has a high level of MSI, equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSI_high (MSI_H) tumor: one with mutations in >30% of microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_H status indicates high_level deficiency in MMR and typically correlates with loss of expression of at least one, and often two, MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_high (MSI_H) has been reported in 1.6_19.7% of ovarian cancer samples (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Plisiecka_Ha\u0142asa et al., 2008; 18507046), including 3.8% (1/26) of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2015; 25195947), and 10.0% (3/30) of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (CCOCs) (Strickland et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5514). No association of MSI_H with stage or survival was found in patients with ovarian cancer (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Aysal et al., 2012; 22189970). On the basis of clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), retifanlimab, and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Shitara et al., 2022; 35322232, Andre et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 244, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143, Berton et al., 2021; SITC Abstract 956), as well as PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (alone or in combination with tremelimumab) (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92, Pietrantonio et al., 2023; ASCO GI Abstract 358, Lee et al., 2023; ASCO GI abstract 401, Rubinstein et al., 2022; 36512912, Marie et al., 2021; 33811152). While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383).

Similar nivolumab efficacy was seen in a retrospective study in a similar setting (Normann et al., 2019; 31074244). In another Phase 2 study, patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer treated with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab experienced significantly improved ORR (31% [16/51] vs. 12% [6/49]) and median PFS (3.9 vs. 2 months; HR=0.53) than those treated with nivolumab alone; median OS was numerically higher in the combinational group (28.1 vs. 21.8 months), although this result did not reach statistical significance (Zamarin et al., 2020; 32275468).

In the TCGA datasets, PIK3R1 mutation is most frequently observed in endometrial carcinoma (33%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398), glioblastoma (GBM; 11%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), uterine carcinosarcoma (11%)(cBioPortal, Jan 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and lower grade glioma (5%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). PIK3R1 is often inactivated by in_frame insertions or deletions (indels), and the majority of this class of mutation (80%) was observed in endometrial carcinoma (Ye et al., 2016; 26657142, Cheung et al., 2011; 21984976, Urick et al., 2011; 21478295), although PIK3R1 indels have been reported in other cancer types such as GBM, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and urothelial bladder carcinoma (Ye et al., 2016; 26657142). On the basis of limited clinical data, reduced PIK3R1 expression has been associated with reduced disease_free survival in prostate cancer (Munkley et al., 2015; 26501081) and metastasis_free survival in breast cancer (Cizkova et al., 2013; 24229379).

In patients with PIK3R1 mutation and no other alterations in the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway, 2 CRs have been achieved by patients with endometrial cancer treated with the pan_PI3K inhibitor pilaralisib (Matulonis et al., 2015; 25528496), and 1 PR has been achieved by a patient with breast cancer treated with the PI3K_alpha inhibitor alpelisib in combination with ribociclib and letrozole (Juric et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract P3_14_01).

PTEN mutations have been reported in <1% of ovarian serous carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365), but may be more common in other subtypes, including endometrioid, with smaller studies identifying mutations 17_34% of cases (Obata et al., 1998; 9605750, Hauke et al., 2019; 30979843, McConechy et al., 2014; 23765252). Loss of heterozygosity at the chromosomal region including PTEN has been reported in 31% (22/72) of epithelial ovarian tumors analyzed, with an incidence of 43% (13/30) in endometrioid tumors and 28% (7/25) in serous tumors and lower incidences in other histological subtypes (Obata et al., 1998; 9605750). Reduced PTEN expression has been reported in 55% (26/47) to 69% (104/151) of ovarian epithelial cancers (Sui et al., 2006; 16525657, Lee and Park, 2009; 19150122). In a study of endometriosis_associated ovarian cancers, loss of PTEN expression has been found in 37% (29/79) of cases (Lai et al., 2013; 23962610). Reduced PTEN expression has been suggested to be associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer (Sk\u00edrnisd\u00f3ttir and Seidal, 2011; 21792012, Sui et al., 2006; 16525657, Lee and Park, 2009; 19150122). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). While most clinical studies of PTEN_deficient cancers have not observed efficacy for inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway, clinical benefit has been reported in limited studies in prostate cancer (Templeton et al., 2013; 23582881, Sweeney et al., 2021; 34246347, de Bono et al., 2019; 30037818, Saura et al., 2017; 27872130), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302), breast cancer (Andre et al., 2016; 27091708, Dent et al., 2021; 34264439, Schmid et al., 2020; 31841354), and colorectal cancer (CRC) (Gilcrease et al., 2019; 30302599). In the TAPUR study, the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus met the prespecified threshold of activity for the cohort of solid tumors with PTEN mutations (ORR 7.4%, DCR 26%, n=27) (Wentzel et al., 2023; AACR Abstract CT231). Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). In a Phase 1 study of patients treated with PARP and AKT inhibitors olaparib and capivasertib, two patients with PTEN_mutated ovarian cancer and a patient with PTEN_mutated endometrial cancer achieved clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD >4 months) (Yap et al, 2020; 32532747). One or more of the PTEN variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hamartoma tumor syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516). The estimated incidence of Cowden syndrome is 1/200,000, which may be an underestimate due to the high variability of this disorder (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191).

Ovarian carcinomas, including peritoneal and Fallopian tube carcinomas, harbor a median TMB of 2.7_3.6 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb) depending upon subtype, and up to 2.1% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a study of high grade serous ovarian cancer, homologous recombination (HR)_deficient tumors, which comprised ~50% of all samples, harbored a higher neoantigen load compared to HR_proficient tumors; higher neoantigen load was associated with longer OS but not disease free survival (Strickland et al., 2016; 26871470). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Atezolizumab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD_L1 and blocks its interaction with PD_1 to enhance antitumor immune responses.

The role of PRC2 in cancer is complex, and the catalytic component EZH2 has been described as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor in different contexts (Xu and Li, 2012; 22475286, Chase and Cross, 2011; 21367748). However, the majority of described EED alterations have loss of function effects (Jain and Di Croce, 2016; 27000413). EED alterations, including frameshift or missense mutations (2%), heterozygous deletions (3_4%), homozygous deletions (10_12%), and concurrent heterozygous deletion and mutation (2_25%), have been frequently observed in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) (Zhang et al., 2014; 25305755, Conway et al., 2015; 26497635, Lee et al., 2014; 25240281, De Raedt et al., 2014; 25119042).

HRD and consequent genomic LOH occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one or more of the homologous recombination pathway proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, ATM, PALB2, and BRIP1 (Vanderstichele et al., 2017; 28950147, Watkins et al., 2014; 25093514, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365, Venkitaraman, 2003; 12736286). This sample harbors a genomic LOH score below levels that have been associated with improved rates of clinical benefit from treatment with the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in patients with platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). However, patients with lower genomic LOH have also responded to rucaparib, and this type of LOH score does not preclude benefit from PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In a study of more than 4,000 ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer samples, genomic LOH score \u2265 16% was identified in 24.2% of BRCA1/2 wild_type cases, deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation was identified in an additional 17.2% of cases, and the remaining 58.7% of cases had LOH score < 16% and were BRCA1/2 wild_type (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). Among the histological subtypes, LOH score \u2265 16% or BRCA1/2 mutation was reported in 42.4% of serous carcinomas, 37.6% of endometrioid carcinomas, 23.5% of carcinosarcomas, 20.6% of neuroendocrine carcinomas, 13.6% of clear cell carcinomas, and 8.1% of mucinous carcinomas; in BRCA1/2 wild_type samples, the median LOH score was significantly higher in serous as compared with non_serous cases (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). In ovarian carcinoma, the median LOH score is significantly higher for BRCA1/2_mutated cases than BRCA1/2 wild_type cases (22.2% vs. 9.8%) (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512), and mutation or methylation of BRCA1, BRCA2, or RAD51C has been reported to be enriched in cases with increased genomic LOH (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Abkevich et al., 2012; 23047548). One study reported no association between LOH and either tumor stage or grade in ovarian serous carcinoma (Marquard et al., 2015; 26015868). In patients with high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma, the frequency of LOH has been reported to increase significantly with age (Pedersen et al., 2013; 23716468). On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma, rucaparib elicited significantly longer median PFS (7.2 vs. 5.0 months, HR=0.51) and improved ORR (33.3% vs. 9.6%, p=0.0003) for patients with LOH score \u2265 16% (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In the maintenance setting in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type patients, rucaparib was superior to placebo in both the LOH score \u2265 16% (median PFS, 9.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.44) and LOH score < 16% (median PFS, 6.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.58) cohorts (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367). Similar results have been reported for maintenance treatment with niraparib in ovarian cancer (Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299) when using a different measure of HRD that includes genomic LOH (Telli et al., 2016; 26957554, Timms et al., 2014; 25475740). Increased LOH has also been associated with improved sensitivity to platinum_containing chemotherapy regimens in patients with ovarian or breast cancer (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Telli et al., 2015; 25847929, Isakoff et al., 2015; 25847936).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MSH6", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "F1088fs*2", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "9.31", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "F1088fs*2"}}, "Interpretation": "MSH6 encodes MutS homolog 6 protein, a member of the mismatch repair (MMR) gene family. Defective MMR occurring as a result of mutation(s) in the MMR family (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2) can result in microsatellite instability (MSI), common in colon, endometrium, and stomach cancers (You et al., 2010; 21081928). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt MSH6 function or expression (Li et al., 2013; 23622243, Wu et al., 2011; 21720545, Edelbrock et al., 2013; 23391514, Berends et al., 2002; 11709755, Warren et al., 2007; 17531815, Geng et al., 2012; 22277660). In the TCGA ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma dataset, MSH6 mutations were found in <1.0% of patients, but no MSH6 losses or rearrangements were reported (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365). The risk of ovarian cancer associated with mutations in MSH6 (approximately 1%) has been reported to be lower than that associated with mutations in MLH1 or MSH2 (12% and 16%, respectively) (Bonadona et al., 2011; 21642682). Numerous studies in various cancer types have shown that MSH6 loss or inactivation is associated with MSI and increased mutation burden (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, You et al., 2010; 21081928, Joly et al., 2015; 25504677, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Rosty et al., 2014; 25117503, McConechy et al., 2015; 25636458). Clinical studies have shown that MSI is associated with patient responses to anti_programmed death 1 (PD_1) immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab (Le et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract LBA100)(Le et al., 2015; 26028255) and nivolumab (Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). Higher mutation burden was also reported to be associated with response to pembrolizumab (Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070). Furthermore, MSI status correlates with higher PD_1 and PD_L1 expression (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179), potential biomarkers of response to PD_1 targeted immunotherapies. Therefore, inactivation of MSH6 may confer sensitivity to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. One or more of the MSH6 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Lynch syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in MSH6 are associated with both \"typical\" and \"atypical\" forms of autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC), which accounts for 1_7% of all colorectal cancers (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295). Approximately 10% of all Lynch syndrome_associated mutations have been attributed to alterations in MSH6 (Peltomaki, 2005; 16083711). Carriers of mutations in MSH6 have a 60_80% risk of colorectal cancer (Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897). Lynch syndrome has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Biallelic germline mutation of MSH6 has been shown to account for 20% of cases of the very rare syndrome Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency (CMMRD), which is characterized by a 95% incidence rate of childhood onset lymphoma, leukemia and brain tumors, followed by early_onset colorectal cancer (reviewed in Wimmer et al., 2008; 18709565, Wimmer et al., 2014; 24737826, Scott et al., 2007; 17259933, Ripperger et al., 2010; 20015892, Baris et al., 2016; 26544533). Given the association between MSH6 and these inherited syndromes, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MSH6 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SMARCA4", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "P109fs*194", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "34.42", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "P109fs*194"}}, "Interpretation": "SMARCA4 encodes the protein BRG1, an ATP_dependent helicase that regulates gene transcription through chromatin remodeling (Wilson and Roberts, 2011; 21654818). SMARCA4 is inactivated in a variety of cancers and considered a tumor suppressor (Shain and Pollack, 2013; 23355908). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt SMARCA4 function or expression (Trotter et al., 2008; 18086889, Shen et al., 2007; 17274598, Dykhuizen et al., 2013; 23698369, Stanton et al., 2016; 27941795, Fernando et al., 2020; 33144586). SMARCA4 mutations have been reported in 1.5% of ovarian serous carcinoma samples analyzed in COSMIC (Oct 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Mutation or loss of SMARCA4 has been shown to be a defining molecular characteristic of small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT)(Conlon et al., 2016; 26645725, Jelinic et al., 2014; 24658004, Witkowski et al., 2014; 24658002, Ramos et al., 2014; 24658001), similar to malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT), leading to the suggestion that treatment regimens used for MRT may be applicable for patients with SCCOHT (Jelinic et al., 2014; 24658004). SMARCA4 mutation or loss has been reported in 83_94% of SCCOHT tumors, and both germline and somatic alterations have been reported (Lin et al., 2017; 29102090, Auguste et al., 2020; 32575483, Bailey et al., 2014; 25307865, Jelinic et al., 2014; 24658004, Witkowski et al., 2014; 24658002, Ramos et al., 2014; 24658001). Several studies have shown loss of BRG1 expression due to SMARCA4 gene mutations in SCCOHT samples (Kupryjanczyk et al., 2013; 24375037), compared with other types of ovarian clear cell carcinomas, which generally retain BRG1 expression (Ramos et al., 2014; 24658001, Huang et al., 2013; 24336158). In one study of 3000 primary gynecological tumor samples, loss of SMARCA4 expression was found in 91% (42/46) of primary SCCOHT samples, but only 4% (15/360) of ovarian clear cell carcinomas; concurrent loss of expression of SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 was found to be highly specific for SCCOHT (Karnezis et al., 2015; 26356327). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of SMARCA4 alterations in ovarian carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Aug 2022). There are no therapies available that target genomic alterations in SMARCA4; however, clinical benefit to targeted agents has been observed for patients with certain SMARCA4_deficient tumor types. Based on clinical and preclinical data, patients with small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) harboring SMARCA4 loss or inactivation may derive benefit from EZH2 inhibitors such as tazemetostat (Jones et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 1612PD, Italiano et al., 2018; 29650362, Penebre et al., 2015; EORTC Abstract C87) or CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib (Xue et al., 2019; 30718512, Xue et al., 2019; 30718506, Lee et al., 2020; 32704608). For patients with SMARCA4_deficient malignant rhabdoid tumors and thoracic undifferentiated tumors, responses have been observed following treatment with anti_PD_1 (Blay et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 11520, Takada et al., 2019; 31617320, Zhu et al., 2021; DOI: 10.31487/j.SCR.2021.11.07) or anti_PD_L1 therapies (Utsumi et al., 2022; 3577899, Kunimasa et al., 2021; 34746887, Kawachi et al., 2021; 34030451).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SOX9", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V306fs*77", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "36.85", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V306fs*77"}}, "Interpretation": "SOX9 encodes a transcription factor important for the development and differentiation of multiple tissues, including cartilage, testis, and prostate (Pritchett et al., 2011; 21237710).
