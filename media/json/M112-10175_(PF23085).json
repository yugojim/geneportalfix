Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. BRIP1 alterations are rare in sarcomas, with 1 mutation and 0 losses detected among 413 patients with sarcoma in two genomic studies (cBio_Barretina et al., 2010; 20601955, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2017; 29100075). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of BRIP1 alterations in sarcoma are limited (PubMed, Feb 2023). On the basis of clinical responses in ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096) and prostate cancer (Abida et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 793PD, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346), as well as clinical benefit in breast cancer (Dhawan et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2527), loss or inactivation of BRIP1 may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. Germline mutations in BRIP1 are associated with increased risk of breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers (Filippini and Vega, 2013; 23747889, Ren et al., 2013; 24301948, Seal et al., 2006; 17033622, Rafnar et al., 2011; 21964575, Ma et al., 2013; 23473757). Germline mutations in BRIP1 are also associated with Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare autosomal disorder that predisposes patients to a subset of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), gynecological malignancies, and head and neck tumors (Alter, 2007; 18024606, Khincha and Savage, 2013; 24246701, Chandrasekharappa et al., 2013; 23613520); frequency estimates suggest an incidence of 3/1,000,000 individuals in Europe and the US, and a heterozygote carrier frequency of 1/181 to 1/300 in the US and Europe, respectively, with slightly higher rates in some populations, such as the Ashkenazi Jewish population (1/89) (Tischkowitz and Hodgson, 2003; 12525534, Khincha and Savage, 2013; 24246701).

Talazoparib has been studied primarily in the context of BRCA_mutated, HER2_negative breast cancer, where patients achieved significantly longer median PFS (8.6 vs. 5.6 months, HR=0.54), a higher ORR (62.6% vs. 27.2%), and improved quality of life on talazoparib compared with standard chemotherapy in a Phase 3 study (Litton et al., 2018; 30110579, Ettl et al., 2018; 30124753).

Objective responses were observed for 80% (32/40) of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, for 29% (24/82) with high LOH, and for 10% (7/10) with low LOH (Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594).

R132 is located within the active site of IDH1 and is a hotspot for mutations in cancer (Jin et al., 2011; 21326614, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146, Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808).

In the Phase 3 ClaIDHy trial, patients with IDH1 R132_mutated cholangiocarcinoma treated with ivosidenib, compared to placebo, had a significantly increased PFS (HR=0.37, p<0.001) and numerically increased OS (HR=0.79, p=0.093) that became significant once adjusted for crossover (HR=0.49, p<0.0001) (Abou_Alfa et al., 2020; 32416072, Abou_Alfa et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4069). For patients with glioma, treatment with ivosidenib resulted in high rates of SD (72.7% [8/11] and 87.5% [21/24] for patients in the dose escalation and expansion cohorts, respectively) (Mellinghoff et al., 2017; SNO Abstract ACTR_46). A cohort of patients with chondrosarcoma that harbored a high incidence of IDH1 R132 mutation (n=15/21) achieved a high rate of SD (55.0% [11/20]), including 3 SDs >1.5 years (Tap et al., 2016; CTOS Abstract P1_138). In a Phase 1 trial for patients with IDH1_mutated solid tumors, including chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and glioma, ivosidenib led to 4 PRs (Fan et al., 2019; 31028664). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04434482", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05021367", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04170153", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05035745", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03784014", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05327010", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04056910", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02769962", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Y220C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Y220C"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 Y220C is targetable by mutation_specific inhibitors such as PC14586 (Dumbrava et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 3003). TP53 mutations and homozygous deletion have been observed in 33% and 9.4% of sarcoma samples in the TCGA dataset, respectively (cBioPortal, Feb 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). TP53 alterations appear to lead to chromosomal instability and drive oncogenesis in soft tissue sarcomas (Perot et al., 2010; 20884963). One study of soft tissue sarcomas reported that TP53 non_frameshift mutations correlated with poor prognosis, including lymph node metastasis, increased rate of relapse, and decreased OS (Taubert et al., 1996; 8797580). Clinical and preclinical data suggest that solid tumors with TP53 mutations, such as R175H, Y220C, G245S, and R248W, may benefit from adoptive cell therapy targeting these specific TP53 mutations (Kim et al., 2022; 35749374, Zacharakis et al 2022; 35104158, Morelli et al., 2023; ASCO Abstract 2547). Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with breast cancer (2 PRs) (Kim et al., 2022; 35749374, Zacharakis et al 2022; 35104158), ovarian cancer (1 PR) (Kim et al., 2022; 35749374), and colorectal cancer (CRC; 1 SD) (Morelli et al., 2023; ASCO Abstract 2547) treated with tumor infiltrating lymphocyte_based or modified T_cell receptor_based adoptive cell therapy. For patients with TP53 Y220C_mutated disease, a Phase 1 study of the Y220C_specific reactivator PC14586 reported an ORR of 32% (8/25) and DCR of 88% (22/25) at higher doses across a variety of solid tumor types (Dumbrava et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 3003). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that TP53 hotspot mutations may predict sensitivity to TP53_targeted adoptive cell therapies.

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). In a computational analysis of paired tumor and normal sarcomas in the TCGA dataset, of which 25% were liposarcomas, only 0.8% (2/255) of samples were MSI_high (MSI_H) (Bonneville et al., 2017; 29850653). However, reports of MSI in sarcomas in the literature are conflicting and varied due to substantial heterogeneity, lack of consensus on the markers and methods used for MSI assessment, and small sample size in most studies (Monument et al., 2012; 23401795). In these smaller studies of soft tissue sarcoma, reports of MSI at any level have been rare, with the highest incidences between 11% (2/18) to 25% (10/40) of cases (Wooster al., 1994; 8162069, Kawaguchi et al., 2005; 15643505, Saito et al., 2003; 14562278, Suwa et al., 1999; 10370164, Garcia et al., 2006; 16619000, Aue et al., 1998; 9689926). In one study, MSI was reported to occur more frequently in high_grade soft tissue sarcomas compared with lower grade (Ruci\u0144ska et al., 2005; 15668629). However, published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in sarcoma are limited (PubMed, Jan 2023). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PHF6", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "loss"}}, "Interpretation": "PHF6 encodes PHD finger protein 6, which has been implicated in ribosomal RNA biogenesis and chromatin remodeling (Wang et al., 2013; 23229552, Todd and Picketts, 2012; 22720776). PHF6 loss_of_function mutations have been associated with hematopoietic malignancies (Van Vlierberghe et al., 2011; 21030981, Todd et al., 2015; 26103525). Mutations in PHF6 underlie the X_linked disorder B\u00f6rjeson_Forssman_Lehmann syndrome (Lower et al., 2002; 12415272, G\u00e9cz et al., 2006; 16912705). PHF6 mutations have been reported in up to 40% of T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T_ALLs) (Van Vlierberghe et al., 2010; 20228800, Van Vlierberghe et al., 2011; 21030981, Grossman et al., 2013; 23341344, Zhang et al., 2012; 22237106, Wang et al., 2011; 21880637, Yoo et al., 2012; 21736506, Holmfeldt and Mullighan, 2010; 20589626, Huh et al., 2013; 23354995). PHF6 mutations are more commonly found in adult T_ALL than pediatric T_ALL and may be associated with reduced overall survival, although this has not been consistently observed (Van Vlierberghe et al., 2010; 20228800, Wang et al., 2011; 21880637).

SGK1 mutation has been observed in 6_16% of diffuse large B_cell lymphomas (cBio_Lohr et al., 2012; 22343534), 5/7 cases of variant nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), and 1/6 cases of typical NLPHL (Hartmann et al., 2016; 26658840). SGK1 amplification and mutation have rarely been observed in other tumor types (cBioPortal, COSMIC, 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Increased SGK1 expression has been reported in lung squamous cell carcinoma (Abbruzzese et al., 2012; 22240294), endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (Conza et al., 2017; 28177128), glioblastoma (Talarico et al., 2016; 26908461), and breast cancer (Sahoo et al., 2005; 16246546). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 has been reported to block SGK1 activity in a preclinical study (Park et al., 1999; 10357815). Several SGK1 inhibitors (Ackermann et al., 2011; 21865856, Castel et al., 2016; 27451907, Halland et al., 2014; 25589934, Mansley et al., 2010; 20880397, O Neill et al., 2015; 26267320, Sherk et al., 2008; 18794135) have been developed but are not suitable for clinical use.

This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Soft tissue sarcomas harbor a median tumor mutational burden (TMB) of 2.4_2.5 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), with angiosarcoma (up to 15%) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (up to 11%) having the highest percentage of cases with high TMB (Gounder et al., 2022; 35705558, FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a study, 3.9% of soft tissue sarcoma samples analyzed harbor TMB \u226510 muts/Mb (Gounder et al., 2022; 35705558); in addition, increased mutational burden has been reported in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas as compared with Ewing sarcomas or rhabdomyosarcomas (Lim et al., 2015; 26330427, Brohl et al., 2014; 25010205, Chen et al., 2013; 24332040). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of tissue TMB in sarcoma are conflicting (PubMed, Feb 2023). High tissue TMB was associated with improved PFS and metastasis_free survival in a study of undifferentiated sarcomas (Steele et al., 2019; 30889380), but with reduced survival in a study of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (Casey et al., 2020; 31699828).

In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "BRIP1", "Alteration": "P488S", "Title": "IMP4297 in Combination With Temozolomide in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Small Cell Lung Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "PARP", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Taichung (Taiwan), Tainan (Taiwan), Gyeonggi_do (Korea, Republic of), Orange (Australia), Blacktown (Australia), Albury (Australia)", "NCTID": "NCT04434482", "Note": "BRIP1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of other DNA repair pathways, including inhibitors of PARP.
