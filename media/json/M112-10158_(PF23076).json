Amplification of CCND1 has been positively correlated with cyclin D1 overexpression (Elsheikh et al., 2008; 17653856) and may lead to excessive proliferation (Fu et al., 2004; 15331580, Takahashi_Yanaga and Sasaguri, 2008; 18023328). CCND1 amplification occurs in 10_17% of invasive breast cancers, more frequently in estrogen receptor (ER)_positive or BRCA_negative cancers, and correlates with overexpression of cyclin D1 (Elsheikh et al., 2008; 17653856, Hadzisejdi\u0107 et al., 2010; 20062009, Bane et al., 2011; 21327470, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897, Holm et al., 2012; 22002566, Peurala et al., 2013; 23336272). Meta_analysis showed that both CCND1 amplification (HR=2.5) and cyclin D1 overexpression (HR=1.7) are associated with poor prognosis in patients with ER_positive breast cancer (Elsheikh et al., 2008; 17653856, Xu et al., 2013; 23670132). Multiple studies reported that cyclin D1 is associated with resistance to endocrine therapy in patients with breast cancer (Lange and Yee, 2011; 21613412, Musgrove and Sutherland, 2009; 19701242). A multi_arm clinical trial of various therapeutic approaches in patients with high_risk breast cancer reported association between high cyclin D1 expression and worse response to chemotherapy alone or in combination with a PARP inhibitor, or to anti_angiogenic therapy (Wulfkuhle et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract 404). In addition, variants lacking PEST domain/3  UTR have been reported to be a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer (Millar et al., 2009; 19287456), and other studies failed to note prognostic significance of the truncated cyclin D1 variant overexpression in breast cancer (Abramson et al., 2010; 20530440). Amplification or overexpression of CCND1 may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Juric et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 568, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Tolaney et al., 2016; SABCS P4_22_12, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 32381571, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Leonard et al., 2012; 22383795), although as monotherapy these agents have shown limited activity in tumor types other than breast cancer (Dickler et al., 2017; 28533223, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383). In refractory advanced solid tumors with CCND1 (n=39) or CCND3 (n=1) amplification and retinoblastoma protein expression, palbociclib resulted in SD for 39% (14/36) of patients and a median PFS of 1.8 months in the NCI_MATCH trial (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2); 4 patients (13%, 4/36 overall) with squamous cell carcinomas (lung, esophageal, or laryngeal) or adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced prolonged SD in this study (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2). Among 9 patients with CCND1_amplified advanced solid tumors, 1 patient with bladder cancer responded to ribociclib in a Phase 2 trial (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CCND1 amplification or overexpression may activate CDK4/6 and may predict sensitivity to single_agent CDK4/6 inhibitors.

Please see the drug label for full prescribing information. </p> <p><b>Gene Association:</b> On the basis of clinical data in breast cancer and mantle cell lymphoma (Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 32381571), CCND1 amplification or activating rearrangement may be associated with response to abemaciclib. In a Phase 1 study, 4 patients with CCND1_amplified breast cancer responded to single_agent abemaciclib, with all the responders having HR+ tumors (Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Biomarker analysis from the Phase 2 nextMONARCH 1 study evaluating abemaciclib monotherapy in patients with heavily pre_treated HR+, HER2_negative metastatic breast cancer revealed that genomic alterations in PIK3CA (3.9 vs. 9.2 months; HR=0.43), TP53 (3.6 vs. 9.0 months; HR=0.66), FGFR1 (3.6 vs. 8.7 months; HR=0.49), MYC (1.9 vs. 9.0 months; HR=0.27), NF1 (3.8 vs. 8.2 months; HR=0.53), EGFR (3.5 vs. 8.8 months; HR=0.4), ERBB2 (4.9 vs. 8.2 months; HR=0.53), or CCNE1 (1.9 vs. 7.4 months; HR=0.35) were associated with a significantly shorter mPFS compared with patients with wildtype status for those genes (Hamilton et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 785). As first_line treatment for postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2_ advanced breast cancer, the addition of abemaciclib to nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors significantly increased median PFS (mPFS; 28.1 vs. 14.8 months, HR=0.54) and ORR (61% vs. 46%) in the placebo_controlled Phase 3 MONARCH 3 study (Johnston et al., 2019; 30675515, Goetz et al., 2017; 28968163). The Phase 2 MONARCH 1 study of abemaciclib as a monotherapy for patients with HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer refractory to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy observed an mPFS of 6 months, an ORR of 20%, and a median OS of 17.7 months (Dickler et al., 2017; 28533223). Abemaciclib also demonstrated clinical benefit for patients with HR+, HER2_ breast cancer who progressed on palbociclib or ribociclib (Wander et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 1057), for patients with brain metastases (Tolaney et al., 2020; 32694159), and in the neoadjuvant setting (Hurvitz et al., 2017; SABCS Abstract PD5_01). The triplet combination of pembrolizumab, abemaciclib, and anastrozole for postmenopausal patients with HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer has been explored in a Phase 1b trial (Rugo et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT108). For pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer, the combination of abemaciclib and tamoxifen yielded an ORR of 20% (3/15) in a Phase 1b study (Beeram et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract LBA18); however, the randomized Phase 2 nextMONARCH1 study showed that the addition of tamoxifen to abemaciclib did not significantly improve PFS or ORR compared with abemaciclib monotherapy for patients with HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer (Hamilton et al., 2021; 33148479). For patients with HR+, HER2+ breast cancer who had received prior HER2_targeted therapy, abemaciclib combined with trastuzumab and fulvestrant (Arm A) compared with abemaciclib plus trastuzumab (Arm B) or trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (Arm C) significantly increased mPFS (8.3 vs. 5.7 vs. 5.7 months; HR=0.67, A vs. C) and ORR (33% vs. 14% vs. 14%) and numerically increased OS (31.1 vs. 29.2 vs. 20.7 months) in a Phase 2 study (Tolaney et al., 2020; 32353342, Andre et al., 2022; ESMO Abstract LBA18). In the Phase 3 monarchE study, as adjuvant treatment for patients with HR+, HER2_ node_positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence, addition of abemaciclib to endocrine therapy improved 4_year invasive disease_free survival (HR=0.664; rates 86% vs. 79%,) and 4_year distant relapse_free survival (HR=0.659; rates 88% vs. 83%) compared with endocrine therapy alone (Johnston et al., 2023; 36493792); similar results were reported for patients enrolled in Asia (Yap et al., 2021; ESMO Breast Abstract 48P). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT05169567", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04975308", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05501886", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05054751", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05594095", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05438810", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05640778", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04858997", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05293964", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGFR4", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "FGFR4_RNF130 non_canonical fusion", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "FGFR4_RNF130 non_canonical fusion"}}, "Interpretation": "FGFR4 encodes fibroblast growth factor receptor 4, a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a role in regulation of the cell cycle and angiogenesis and is an upstream regulator of the RAS, MAPK, and AKT signaling pathways (Powers et al., 2000; 11021964, Turner and Grose, 2010; 20094046). Missense mutations at residues G388, N535, and V550 of FGFR4 have been shown to be activating (Taylor et al., 2009; 19809159, Shukla et al., 2012; 22142829, Haugsten et al., 2010; 21047773, Wang et al., 2008; 18670643), whereas truncation of the most C_terminal 11 amino acids has been reported to inactivate FGFR4 (Klingenberg et al., 2000; 10769213). However, other missense mutations and larger C_terminal truncations have not been functionally characterized, and their effects on FGFR4 function are unknown. Such alterations have been reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of FGFR4 was reported in <1% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897). FGFR4 amplification and gene overexpression have been detected in 10% and 32% of breast tumors, respectively, in the literature (Jaakkola et al., 1993; 8099571, Penault_Llorca et al., 1995; 7705943). One study reported that the putative activating FGFR4 R388 polymorphism correlated with increased metastasis, reduced disease_free survival time, and overall poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer; however, the prognostic implications of FGFR4 amplification were not reported (Bange et al., 2002; 11830541, Thussbas et al., 2006; 16822847). Tumors with FGFR4 amplification or activating mutations may be sensitive to certain pan_FGFR inhibitors, and clinical trials of some of these agents are currently underway in solid tumors, including erdafitinib (Perera et al., 2017; 28341788) and LY2874455 (Wu et al., 2016; 27618313). The multikinase inhibitor ponatinib has been shown to have substantial activity against all four FGFR kinases (Cortes et al., 2012; ASH Abstract 163, Gozgit et al., 2012; 22238366).

It is an oncogene and may be activated in as many as 20% of cancers (Dang et al., 2006; 16904903). MYC dysregulation (amplification, overexpression, translocation) has been identified in a number of different cancer types (Nesbit et al., 1999; 10378696). MYC amplification has been significantly linked with increased mRNA and protein levels and results in the dysregulation of a large number of target genes (Blancato et al., 2004; 15083194, Dang et al., 2006; 16904903, Fromont et al., 2013; 23574779). MYC amplification has been reported in 8.6_26% of breast carcinomas (cBio_Razavi et al., 2018; 30205045, cBio_Ciriello et al., 2015; 26451490, cBio_Pereira et al., 2016; 27161491). MYC amplification has been associated with an aggressive phenotype, early onset, and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer, although the data have been conflicting (Chen and Olopade, 2008; 18925859, Xu et al., 2010; 21779462, Colak et al., 2013; 23704896, Pereira et al., 2013; 23555992). Limited clinical data indicates that MYC activation may predict sensitivity to the pan_MYC inhibitor OMO_103; a Phase 1 study for patients with solid tumors reported 7 SDs (n=18), including 8% tumor reduction in a patient with pancreas adenocarcinoma (Garralda et al., 2022; ENA Abstract 7). Preclinical data indicate MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to investigational agents targeting CDK1 (Horiuchi et al., 2012; 22430491, Goga et al., 2007; 17589519), CDK2 (Molenaar et al., 2009; 19525400), Aurora kinase A (Dammert et al., 2019; 31375684, Mollaoglu et al., 2017; 28089889, Robert et al., 2017; 29088717, Wang et al., 2017; 28417568, Takahashi et al., 2015; 25632068, Li et al., 2018; 30226440, Kong et al., 2017; DOI: 10.21037/tcr.2017.06.41, Mahadeva et al., 2014; 24893165, Park et al., 2019; 31429028), Aurora kinase B (Helfrich et al., 2016; 27496133, Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Yang et al., 2010; 20643922, He et al., 2019; 30540594), glutaminase (Shroff et al., 2015; 25964345, Effenberger et al., 2017; 29156762, Shen et al., 2018; 30103944, Xiang et al., 2015; 25915584), or BET bromodomain_containing proteins (Delmore et al., 2011; 21889194, Bandopadhayay et al., 2013; 24297863, Loven et al., 2013; 23582323, Otto et al., 2019; 31734632), as well as agents targeting both HDAC and PI3K (Dong et al., 2013; 23866964, Pei et al., 2016; 26977882; Fu et al., 2019; 30224636). Exploratory biomarker analysis in a Phase 2 study reported a PFS benefit associated with a combination of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib and paclitaxel as second_line therapy for patients with MYC_overexpressed small cell lung cancer, but not for patients without MYC overexpression (Owonikoko et al., 2020; 31655296). A PR was reported for a patient with MYC_amplified invasive ductal breast carcinoma treated with an unspecified Aurora kinase inhibitor and taxol (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784). In the context of hormone_receptor_positive HER2_negative breast cancer, retrospective analysis of clinical data showed that MYC alterations were associated with inferior median PFS after treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant compared with unaltered MYC in a limited number of patients (HR=1.01 vs. HR=0.49, n=13 vs. 107) (Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1006). MYC amplification has also been suggested to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer in some studies (Pereira et al., 2013; 23555992, Yasojima et al., 2011; 21741827). Preclinical evidence suggests that colon cancer cells with MYC amplification may be more sensitive to 5_fluorouracil and paclitaxel (Arango et al., 2001; 11406570, Bottone et al., 2003; 14516787).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to inhibition of CDKs, especially CDK1 and CDK2, of Aurora kinases, including Aurora kinase A and B, and of BET domain proteins, which are reported to downregulate MYC expression and MYC_dependent transcriptional programs.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04553133", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03901469", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05253053", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04983810", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252390", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05327010", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04742959", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05053971", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04840589", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04555837", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NF1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "S1140*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "38.44", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S1140*"}}, "Interpretation": "NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase_activating protein (GAP) that is a key negative regulator of the RAS signaling pathway (Hattori et al., 1991; 1904223).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt NF1 function or expression (Ballester et al., 1990; 2121371, Xu et al., 1990; 2116237, Martin et al., 1990; 2121370, Thomas et al., 2012; 22807134, Skuse and Cappione, 1997; 9300663, Morcos et al., 1996; 8628317, Messiaen et al., 1999; 11258625, Ars et al., 2000; 10607834, Messiaen and Wimmer, 2005; 15863657, Poullet et al., 1994; 8264648).

NF1 alterations are enriched in metastatic breast invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) compared to metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma (12.2% vs 3.1%), and are often mutually exclusive with ESR1 alterations (Sokol et al., 2019; 30423024). NF1 alterations have been reported to arise during endocrine therapy resistance in ILC (Sokol et al., 2019; 30423024). Studies have suggested that women with neurofibromatosis type 1, which is associated with germline NF1 mutations, may have an increased risk of breast cancer (Madanikia et al., 2012; 23165953, Wang et al., 2012; 22965642, G\u00fcran and Safali, 2005; 15588864, Ceccaroni et al., 2002; 12217765, Jett and Friedman, 2010; 20027112). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of NF1 alteration in breast cancer are limited (PubMed, Jan 2023). On the basis of clinical evidence in neurofibromatosis type 1_associated neurofibroma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (Dombi et al., 2016; 28029918, Schalkwijk et al., 2021; 33903938, Glassberg et al., 2020; ASPHO Abstract 2015, Coyne et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3612, McCowage et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 10504, Mueller et al., 2020; SNO Abstract NFB_17, Hitchen et al., 2023; 36743881, Nagabushan et al., 2021; 33580196, Hones et al., 2022; 36192032), central nervous system tumors including glioma and astrocytoma (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Manoharan et al., 2020; 32780261, Romo et al., 2019; SNO Abstract RARE_54, Awada et al., 2020; 33082744, Wisinski et al., 2023; 37053535), limited clinical evidence for MEK inhibitors in non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Middleton et al., 2020; 32669708, Wisinski et al., 2023; 37053535), and in combination with chemotherapy for biliary tract cancers (Lowery et al., 2019; 30563938), NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors such as cobimetinib, trametinib, binimetinib, and selumetinib. On the basis of limited clinical data (Lim et al., 2016; 26859683 , Weiss et al., 2015; 25314964, Janku et al., 2014; 24931142) and preclinical data (Johannessen et al., 2008; 18164202, Johannessen et al., 2005; 15937108), loss or inactivation of NF1 may predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, including everolimus and temsirolimus. A preclinical study suggests that combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is effective in a model of NF1_deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) (Malone et al., 2014; 24913553). Germline mutations in NF1 cause the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized in part by increased risk of developing various tumors, including sarcoma, glioma, breast carcinoma, and neuroendocrine and hematological neoplasms (Jett and Friedman, 2010; 20027112, Patil and Chamberlain, 2012; 22240541, Evans et al., 2012; 23036231). Estimates for the prevalence of the disorder in the general population range from 1:2,500 to 1:3,000 (Upadhyaya et al., 1995; 8544190, Williams et al., 2009; 19117870), and in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of NF1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "On the basis of clinical evidence and strong preclinical evidence, NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.

The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA amplification has been reported in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and correlated with poor prognosis in certain tumor types (Suda et al., 2012; 22994622, Shi et al., 2012; 22292935). PIK3CA amplification has also been associated with sensitivity to PI3K_alpha inhibitors in preclinical studies (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA amplification has been reported in up to 3% of invasive breast carcinoma cases analyzed (Ciriello et al., 2015; 26451490). Mutations in PIK3CA have been reported in up to 37% of breast cancer cases (Razavi et al., 2018; 30205045, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 23000897). In the randomized Phase 2 SAFIR02 trial, PIK3CA mutations were associated with reduced OS in patients with hormone_receptor_positive (HR+)/HER2 negative (HER_) metastatic breast cancer but with improved OS in patients with mTNBC compared to patients with PIK3CA wildtype status (Mosele et al., 2020; 32067679). Although double PIK3CA mutations were frequently observed in HR+/HER2_ breast cancers, as compared with other receptor subtypes (15% vs. 5.4%, p=0.004), this did not impact invasive disease_free survival or OS for patients when compared with single PIK3CA mutations by univariate and multivariate analysis in 1 retrospective study (Vasan et al., 2019; 31699932). For patients with HER2+ breast cancer receiving trastuzumab and pertuzumab with chemotherapy, PIK3CA mutations significantly associated with shorter PFS (13 vs. 23 months; HR=1.98)(Ferraro et al., 2021; SABCS Abstract GS3_03). Mutations in coding exon 20 (H1047R) of PIK3CA have been associated with a better prognosis in breast carcinoma than mutations occurring in coding exon 9 (E542K) (Barbareschi et al., 2007; 17947469). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). A Phase 2 trial of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone showed a median OS benefit for the overall population (19.1 vs. 12.6 months; HR=0.61), for patients with AKT1_, PTEN_, or PIK3CA_mutated triple_negative breast cancer (TNBC) (not reached vs. 10.4 months; HR=0.37), and for patients with TNBC without PI3K_pathway mutations (16.6 vs. 13.2 months; HR=0.84) (Schmid et al., 2020; 31841354). In a Phase 2 trial, the addition of capivasertib to fulvestrant improved median PFS (mPFS) relative to fulvestrant plus placebo alone for patients with PIK3CA_, AKT1_, and/or PTEN_altered hormone_receptor_positive (HR+), HER2_ metastatic breast cancer (12.8 vs. 4.6 months, HR=0.44) (Howell et al., 2022; 35671774), although the Phase 3 CAPItello study of capivasertib with fulvestrant for patients with HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer reported improved median PFS (mPFS) relative to fulvestrant plus placebo for patients with and without alterations in the AKT pathway (7.3 vs 3.1 months, HR=0.50 and 7.2 vs 3.7 months, HR=0.70, respectively) (Turner et al., 2022; SABCS Abstract GS3_04). In a Phase 2 basket trial of capivasertib monotherapy in AKT1_mutated cancers, 33% (2/6) of patients with HR+, HER2_ or TNBC experienced PRs, and 2 other PRs were unconfirmed (Turner et al., 2020; 32919527). Despite promising initial results in earlier trials (Saura et al., 2017; 27872130, Kim et al., 2017; 28800861), the Phase 3 IPATunity130 trial failed to show improved PFS for first_line ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel relative to paclitaxel alone for patients with AKT1_, PTEN_, or PIK3CA_mutated TNBC (7.4 vs. 6.1 months) (Dent et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract GS3_04) or HR+, HER2_ breast cancer (Turner et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 283MO). In the Phase 3 SOLAR_1 study, the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant statistically improved PFS (11.0 vs. 5.7 months, HR=0.65) and ORR (27% vs. 13%) and numerically improved median OS (mOS; 39.3 vs. 31.4 months, HR=0.86) in PIK3CA_mutated hormone_receptor_positive (HR+), HER2_ breast cancer compared with placebo with fulvestrant, but not in PIK3CA_wildtype HR+, HER2_ breast cancer (Andre et al., 2021; 33246021). In a Phase 2 trial, the addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to fulvestrant improved median PFS (mPFS) for patients with PIK3CA_, AKT1_, and/or PTEN_altered HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer (12.8 vs. 4.6 months, HR=0.44) (Jones et al., 2020; 32035020, Howell et al., 2022; 35671774). A Phase 2 study of alpelisib monotherapy for patients harboring PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ breast cancer reported an ORR of 38% (10/26), mPFS of 5.4 months, median OS of 18.8 months, and median duration of response of 5.6 months; no responses (0% ORR [0/7]) were reported for PIK3CA_mutated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (Savas et al., 2022; 35771551). Single_agent capivasertib also demonstrated activity in a Phase 1 study (Banerji et al., 2018; 29066505). In trials of AKT inhibitors with paclitaxel, neither capivasertib nor ipatasertib showed significant mPFS benefit for patients with PI3K pathway_mutated HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer compared with paclitaxel plus placebo (Turner et al., 2019; 30860570, Turner et al., 2020; Abstract 283MO). In a Phase 1 study, the PIK3CA_selective inhibitor inavolisib (GDC_0077) alone or in combination with endocrine therapy (letrozole or fulvestrant) with or without palbociclib yielded an ORR of 32% (23/73) for patients with PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ breast cancer, with an ORR of 40% (6/15) observed for patients who received inavolisib plus palbociclib and fulvestrant (Jhaveri et al., 2020; Abstract PS5_12, Bedard et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD1_02). A Phase 1 study of combination palbociclib, fulvestrant, and the pan_PIK3CA inhibitor taselisib reported an ORR of 38% (9/24), DCR of 58% (14/24), and mPFS of 7.2 months for patients with PIK3CA_mutated ER+, HER2_ breast cancer (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). The addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to exemestane to treat HR+, HER2_ advanced breast cancer has shown clinical benefit, regardless of PIK3CA status (Moynahan et al., 2017; 28183140, Hortobagyi et al., 2016; 26503204). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the context of hormone_receptor_positive HER2_negative breast cancer, retrospective analysis of clinical data showed that MYC alterations were associated with inferior median PFS after treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant compared with unaltered MYC in a limited number of patients (HR=1.01 vs. HR=0.49, n=13 vs. 107) (Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1006).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

In ER+/HER2\u2013 breast cancer, PFS benefit from the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant was specifically observed for patients with PIK3CA mutations (11.0 vs. 5.7 months, HR=0.65), including patients with PIK3CA exon 9 or exon 20 mutations (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> In the Phase 3 SOLAR_1 study for patients with HR+, HER2_ endocrine_therapy_resistant advanced breast cancer, the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant significantly improved median PFS (mPFS; 11.0 vs. 5.7 months, HR=0.65), ORR (27% vs. 13%), clinical benefit rate (62% vs. 45%), and numerically improved median OS (mOS; 39.3 vs. 31.4 months, HR=0.86) for patients with PIK3CA mutations (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Andre et al., 2021; 33246021); patients with wildtype PIK3CA did not experience significant mPFS benefit (7.4 vs. 5.6 months, HR=0.85) (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374). This trial excluded patients with active brain metastases; however, control of progressive brain metastases (1/4 PR and 2/4 SDs by response assessment in neuro_oncology brain metastases criteria) was reported in a case series of 4 patients with PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ breast cancer treated with alpelisib in combination with either fulvestrant or exemestane (Batalini et al., 2020; 32923889). The Phase 2 BYLieve study for previously treated patients with PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ advanced breast cancer reported an ORR of 19%, an mPFS of 7.3 months, and an mOS of 26.4 months for patients treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant following progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) (Ciruelos et al., 2021; SABCS Abstract P1_18_03); patients who progressed more quickly on their prior CDK4/6 inhibitor plus AI regimen (<6 months) experienced greater mPFS benefit from alpelisib plus fulvestrant (12.0 vs. 6.2 months) than patients who experienced delayed progression (>6 months) (Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1018).

In a Phase 2 trial, the addition of capivasertib to fulvestrant improved median PFS (mPFS) relative to fulvestrant plus placebo alone for patients with PIK3CA_, AKT1_, and/or PTEN_altered hormone_receptor_positive (HR+), HER2_ metastatic breast cancer (12.8 vs. 4.6 months, HR=0.44) (Howell et al., 2022; 35671774), although the Phase 3 CAPItello study of capivasertib with fulvestrant for patients with HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer reported improved median PFS (mPFS) relative to fulvestrant plus placebo for patients with and without alterations in the AKT pathway (7.3 vs 3.1 months, HR=0.50 and 7.2 vs 3.7 months, HR=0.70, respectively) (Turner et al., 2022; SABCS Abstract GS3_04). In a Phase 2 basket trial of capivasertib monotherapy in AKT1_mutated cancers, 33% (2/6) of patients with HR+, HER2_ or TNBC experienced PRs, and 2 other PRs were unconfirmed (Turner et al., 2020; 32919527). Despite promising initial results in earlier trials (Saura et al., 2017; 27872130, Kim et al., 2017; 28800861), the Phase 3 IPATunity130 trial failed to show improved PFS for first_line ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel relative to paclitaxel alone for patients with AKT1_, PTEN_, or PIK3CA_mutated TNBC (7.4 vs. 6.1 months) (Dent et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract GS3_04) or HR+, HER2_ breast cancer (Turner et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 283MO). In the Phase 3 SOLAR_1 study, the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant statistically improved PFS (11.0 vs. 5.7 months, HR=0.65) and ORR (27% vs. 13%) and numerically improved median OS (mOS; 39.3 vs. 31.4 months, HR=0.86) in PIK3CA_mutated hormone_receptor_positive (HR+), HER2_ breast cancer compared with placebo with fulvestrant, but not in PIK3CA_wildtype HR+, HER2_ breast cancer (Andre et al., 2021; 33246021). In a Phase 2 trial, the addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to fulvestrant improved median PFS (mPFS) for patients with PIK3CA_, AKT1_, and/or PTEN_altered HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer (12.8 vs. 4.6 months, HR=0.44) (Jones et al., 2020; 32035020, Howell et al., 2022; 35671774). A Phase 2 study of alpelisib monotherapy for patients harboring PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ breast cancer reported an ORR of 38% (10/26), mPFS of 5.4 months, median OS of 18.8 months, and median duration of response of 5.6 months; no responses (0% ORR [0/7]) were reported for PIK3CA_mutated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (Savas et al., 2022; 35771551). Single_agent capivasertib also demonstrated activity in a Phase 1 study (Banerji et al., 2018; 29066505). In trials of AKT inhibitors with paclitaxel, neither capivasertib nor ipatasertib showed significant mPFS benefit for patients with PI3K pathway_mutated HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer compared with paclitaxel plus placebo (Turner et al., 2019; 30860570, Turner et al., 2020; Abstract 283MO). In a Phase 1 study, the PIK3CA_selective inhibitor inavolisib (GDC_0077) alone or in combination with endocrine therapy (letrozole or fulvestrant) with or without palbociclib yielded an ORR of 32% (23/73) for patients with PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ breast cancer, with an ORR of 40% (6/15) observed for patients who received inavolisib plus palbociclib and fulvestrant (Jhaveri et al., 2020; Abstract PS5_12, Bedard et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD1_02). A Phase 1 study of combination palbociclib, fulvestrant, and the pan_PIK3CA inhibitor taselisib reported an ORR of 38% (9/24), DCR of 58% (14/24), and mPFS of 7.2 months for patients with PIK3CA_mutated ER+, HER2_ breast cancer (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). The addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to exemestane to treat HR+, HER2_ advanced breast cancer has shown clinical benefit, regardless of PIK3CA status (Moynahan et al., 2017; 28183140, Hortobagyi et al., 2016; 26503204). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the context of hormone_receptor_positive HER2_negative breast cancer, retrospective analysis of clinical data showed that MYC alterations were associated with inferior median PFS after treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant compared with unaltered MYC in a limited number of patients (HR=1.01 vs. HR=0.49, n=13 vs. 107) (Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1006).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

In ER+/HER2\u2013 breast cancer, PFS benefit from the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant was specifically observed for patients with PIK3CA mutations (11.0 vs. 5.7 months, HR=0.65), including patients with PIK3CA exon 9 or exon 20 mutations (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> In the Phase 3 SOLAR_1 study for patients with HR+, HER2_ endocrine_therapy_resistant advanced breast cancer, the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant significantly improved median PFS (mPFS; 11.0 vs. 5.7 months, HR=0.65), ORR (27% vs. 13%), clinical benefit rate (62% vs. 45%), and numerically improved median OS (mOS; 39.3 vs. 31.4 months, HR=0.86) for patients with PIK3CA mutations (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Andre et al., 2021; 33246021); patients with wildtype PIK3CA did not experience significant mPFS benefit (7.4 vs. 5.6 months, HR=0.85) (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374). This trial excluded patients with active brain metastases; however, control of progressive brain metastases (1/4 PR and 2/4 SDs by response assessment in neuro_oncology brain metastases criteria) was reported in a case series of 4 patients with PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ breast cancer treated with alpelisib in combination with either fulvestrant or exemestane (Batalini et al., 2020; 32923889). The Phase 2 BYLieve study for previously treated patients with PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ advanced breast cancer reported an ORR of 19%, an mPFS of 7.3 months, and an mOS of 26.4 months for patients treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant following progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) (Ciruelos et al., 2021; SABCS Abstract P1_18_03); patients who progressed more quickly on their prior CDK4/6 inhibitor plus AI regimen (<6 months) experienced greater mPFS benefit from alpelisib plus fulvestrant (12.0 vs. 6.2 months) than patients who experienced delayed progression (>6 months) (Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1018). The Phase 2 BYLieve trial also reported an ORR of 16% and an mPFS of 5.7 months for patients treated with alpelisib plus letrozole following progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with fulvestrant, benefit did not differ by duration of prior treatment (Rugo et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD2_07, Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1018), and an ORR of 24% and an mPFS of 5.6 months for patients treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant who had previously progressed on aromatase inhibitors and received chemotherapy or endocrine therapy (Rugo et al., 2021; SABCS Abstract PD13_05). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04191499", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05646862", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04589845", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05720260", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05501886", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04544189", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04524000", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05594095", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04631835", "Include": "true"}]}}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGF19", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FGF19 encodes fibroblast growth factor 19, an FGFR4 ligand involved with bile acid synthesis and hepatocyte proliferation in the liver (Xie et al., 1999; 10525310, Hagel et al., 2015; 25776529). FGF19 lies in a region of chromosome 11q13 that also contains FGF3, FGF4, and CCND1; this region is frequently amplified in a diverse range of malignancies (Katoh et al., 2002; 12429977). Correlation between FGF19 amplification and protein expression has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)(Kan et al., 2013; 23788652), lung squamous cell carcinoma (Li et al., 2020; 32111983, Caruso et al., 2019; 31063779), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)(Gao et al., 2019; 30518874), but was not observed in other cancers (Sawey et al., 2011; 21397858, Kanzaki et al., 2021; 33674622).

FGF19 mutations are rare in solid tumors (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). FGF19 expression or amplification has been associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)(Miura et al., 2012; 22309595, Kang et al., 2019; 30815392), and in prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy (Nagamatsu et al., 2015; 25854696).

A Phase 1 study of the FGFR4 inhibitor fisogatinib (BLU_554) for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) reported a 17% ORR (11/66, 1 CR, ongoing for >1.5 years) and 3.3_month PFS for FGF19 IHC\u2013positive patients; patients with negative or unknown FGF19 IHC scores experienced poorer outcomes (0% ORR, 2.3_month PFS)(Kim et al., 2019; 31575541). A Phase 1/2 study evaluating another FGFR4 inhibitor, FGF401, demonstrated an ORR of 7.5% (4/53) and SD rate of 53% (28/53) for patients with HCC (Chan et al., 2017; AACR Abstract CT106). A Phase 1 study of the FGFR4 inhibitor H3B_6527 reported a 17% ORR (OS of 10.3 months, 46% clinical benefit rate) among patients with HCC; enrollment of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) was suspended due to efficacy (Macarulla et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4090).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947).

Notably, in Lynch syndrome\u2013related breast cancer, MSI has been reported in 51_85% of cases (Walsh et al., 2010; 20215533, Risinger et al., 1996; 8646682, De Leeuw et al., 2003; 12615735, Shanley et al., 2009; 19123071, Buerki et al., 2012; 22034109, Yee et al., 1994; 8137273). A prospective study of 123 patients with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy reported an increase in the incidence of MSI_H following chemotherapy treatment (from 0% pre_treatment to 19% post_treatment) and a significant association between MSI and tumor recurrence (Kamat et al., 2012; 22928966). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RAD21", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "RAD21 encodes a protein involved in DNA double_strand break repair and sister chromatid cohesion as a part of the cohesin complex (Xu et al., 2011; 21326324, Hill et al., 2016; 27207471, Solomon et al., 2014; 24856830, Bauerschmidt et al., 2010; 19906707).

RAD21 expression has been associated with shorter recurrence_free survival (RFS) for patients with breast cancer (Xu et al., 2011; 21255398). There are no therapies to target alterations in this gene.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R248Q", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "40.46", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R248Q"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in breast cancer; mutations in this gene have been identified in 27_37% of breast carcinoma samples (cBio_Banerji et al., 2012; 22722202, cBio_Stephens et al., 2012; 22722201, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897, Alsner et al., 2008; 18465328, Alkam et al., 2013; 24004112, Uji et al., 2014; 23973262). TP53 mutations that are located within the region encoding the DNA binding domain are associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer (Alsner et al., 2008; 18465328, Olivier et al., 2006; 16489069, V\u00e9gran et al., 2013; 23359294). TP53 mutation is also implicated in breast cancer susceptibility, as TP53 mutation carriers have an 18_60 fold increased risk for early onset breast cancer (Walsh et al., 2006; 16551709, Garber and Offit, 2005; 15637391, Apostolou and Fostira, 2013; 23586058). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Apr 2023)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). One study reported that invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast has a median TMB of 3.6 mutations per megabase (Muts/Mb), with 1.4% of cases harboring TMB \u226520 Muts/Mb (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Another study found that 4% of breast IDC cases have TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb, with a higher frequency of such elevated TMB (7.8%) in metastatic samples (Barroso_Sousa et al., 2020; 32067680). A study of 3,969 patients with breast cancer reported a median TMB of 2.63 mutations per megabase (Muts/Mb), with 5% of cases harboring TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb; median TMB was significantly higher in hormone receptor (HR)_negative and HER2_negative tumors than HR_positive or HER2_positive tumors (Barroso_Sousa et al., 2020; 32067680). The Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA analysis reported an average (non_silent) mutation load of 0.84 Muts/Mb for luminal A tumors, 1.38 Muts/Mb for luminal B tumors, 2.05 Muts/Mb for HER2_enriched tumors, and 1.68 Muts/Mb for basal_like tumors (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 23000897). In breast cancer, TMB is significantly higher in recurrent versus primary tumors, metastatic versus localized cancers, triple_negative versus HR_positive tumors, and CDH1_mutated versus CDH1_wildtype tumors (Sokol et al., 2019; 30423024, Barroso_Sousa et al., 2020; 32067680, Chumsri et al., 2020; 32380464, Israel et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD9_09). Among metastatic tumors, TMB_high samples have been reported more frequently in invasive lobular carcinoma (9_17% of cases, depending on the TMB cutoff to designate TMB_high) than in invasive ductal carcinoma (2_8% of cases, depending on the cutoff), and TMB_high (at either cutoff) has not been observed in papillary carcinoma (Sokol et al., 2019; 30423024, Barroso_Sousa et al., 2020; 32067680, Chumsri et al., 2020; 32380464, Israel et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD9_09). Breast carcinoma harbors a median TMB of 3.8 muts/Mb, and 3.1% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb) (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a large study of patients with breast cancer, hypermutation was more frequently observed in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors (Barroso_Sousa et al., 2020; 32067680). In a study of 14,867 patients with breast cancer, high TMB was associated with older age and metastatic disease but was not significantly associated with PD_L1 positivity using the TMB cutoff of \u226510 Muts/Mb (Chumsri et al., 2020; 32380464). In estrogen receptor_positive breast cancer, increased TMB in tissue samples (>mean of 1.25 Muts/Mb) associated with shorter OS (HR=2.02) in an analysis of the TCGA data (Haricharan et al., 2014; 24839032). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "CCND1", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Abemaciclib (LY2835219) Plus Fulvestrant Compared to Placebo Plus Fulvestrant in Previously Treated Breast Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 3", "Target": "CDK6, ER, CDK4", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Taoyuan (Taiwan), New Taipei City (Taiwan), Tainan City (Taiwan), Kaohsiung (Taiwan), Daegu (Korea, Republic of), Seongnam (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Diyarbakir (Turkey), Adana (Turkey)", "NCTID": "NCT05169567", "Note": "CCND1 amplification or overexpression may activate CDK4/6 and may predict sensitivity to single_agent CDK4/6 inhibitors.
